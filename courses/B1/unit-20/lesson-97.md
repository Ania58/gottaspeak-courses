## Warm-up – When Enough Is Enough

2. Is it difficult for you to set boundaries at work or with friends?
3. What usually happens when people don’t stand up for themselves?

## Grammar Focus – Giving Stronger Advice

At B1 level, we move beyond **should** and learn how to give **stronger, more realistic advice**.

### ➤ should / shouldn’t  
General advice.

- You **should** speak to your manager.  
- You **shouldn’t** ignore the problem.

---

### ➤ ought to  
More formal and slightly stronger than *should*.

- You **ought to** apologise.  
- They **ought to** respect your time.

---

### ➤ had better (+ base verb)  
Strong advice with a possible negative consequence.

- You **had better** deal with this today.  
- You **had better not** ignore the client.

⚠ This is **not past tense**. It refers to **now or the future**.

---

### ➤ It’s time + past simple  
Used to criticise or suggest that change is necessary.

- It’s time you **took** responsibility.  
- It’s time they **stopped** blaming others.

(We use a past form, but the meaning is present/future.)

## Reading – When Saying “Yes” Becomes a Problem

Marta had always been the reliable one at work. If someone needed help, she stepped up. If a deadline was tight, she stayed late. At first, it made her feel valued.

Over time, people started taking her for granted. Her manager assumed she would always accept extra work. Her colleagues stopped checking details because “Marta will fix it anyway”.

One day, a client complaint landed on her desk. It wasn’t her mistake, but she was expected to deal with it. That was the moment she realised something had crossed the line.

“It’s time I drew the line,” she thought.

At the next meeting, she calmly explained that everyone ought to take responsibility for their own tasks. She added that if the situation continued, she would no longer cover for others.

The meeting was uncomfortable, but effective. One colleague backed down and admitted his mistake. Her manager agreed they had better redistribute the workload more fairly.

Setting boundaries didn’t make her unpopular. It made her respected.
