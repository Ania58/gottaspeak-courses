## Grammar Focus – Past Simple vs Present Perfect

We often report problems using **two time perspectives**:

### ➤ Past Simple  
(use when the problem happened at a specific time)

- The system **crashed yesterday**.  
- I **sent** the wrong file this morning.

### ➤ Present Perfect  
(use when the problem affects the situation now)

- The system **has stopped working**, so we can’t continue.  
- I **have sent** the wrong file, and now the client is confused.

**Key idea:**  
Past simple = what happened  
Present perfect = why it matters now

## Reading – A Small Problem That Became a Big One

Last Friday, a small technical issue caused unexpected chaos in a local office.  
The IT system that employees use to log their working hours stopped responding just before noon.

At first, people thought it was a temporary glitch. Someone restarted the system, but it didn’t help. By mid-afternoon, several employees had already entered incorrect data, and others couldn’t access their accounts at all.

The manager realised that the situation had affected the entire team. Some workers had already left for the weekend, while others stayed late trying to sort out the problem. Unfortunately, the issue wasn’t resolved until Monday morning.

Because the system had been down for several hours, payroll had to be recalculated manually. What started as a small technical breakdown turned into a serious administrative headache.
