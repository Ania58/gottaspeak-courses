## Reading – Too Late to Change?

Daniel often looks back at his early twenties and shakes his head. At the time, he thought there would always be more opportunities. If only he knew how fast things could change.

He turned down a job offer abroad because it felt risky. He stayed in a role he didn’t enjoy because it was comfortable. “I wish I took more chances,” he says now.

Looking back, he realises he took stability for granted. Friends who stepped out of their comfort zones moved forward, while he stayed in the same place. Beating himself up doesn’t help, but ignoring the feeling doesn’t either.

Eventually, Daniel decided to learn the hard way and use regret as motivation. He can’t change the past, but he can stop missing out on the future.
