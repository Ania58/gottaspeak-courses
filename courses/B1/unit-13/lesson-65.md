## Reading – Defending an Opinion in a Digital World

Public discussion has become faster and louder than ever. Social platforms allow people to express opinions instantly, but they also increase pressure to react quickly and emotionally. As a result, many people share views without fully reflecting on them.

Defending an opinion today is not only about being right. It also involves listening, recognising influence, and taking responsibility for the impact of words. Online discussions can shape behaviour, public awareness and even political decisions. For this reason, communication carries real consequences.

People who express their viewpoints clearly and respectfully are more likely to be heard. They support their ideas with reasons, remain open to other perspectives and avoid personal attacks. This approach not only strengthens their arguments but also builds trust.

Having a voice is powerful. Knowing how to use it thoughtfully is a skill that affects relationships, workplaces and society as a whole.
