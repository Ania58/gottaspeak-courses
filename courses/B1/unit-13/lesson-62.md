## Grammar Focus – Agreeing and Disagreeing Politely

In real communication, people often:

- agree fully  
- agree partly  
- disagree politely  

### ➤ Agreeing

- I agree.  
- I think so too.  
- Exactly.  
- That’s true.

Examples:  
- I agree. Communication is essential.  
- That’s true. Experience really matters.

### ➤ Partly agreeing

- I agree to some extent, but…  
- That’s true, however…  
- I see your point, but…

Examples:  
- I agree to some extent, but money isn’t everything.  
- I see your point, but not everyone has the same opportunities.

---

### ➤ Disagreeing politely

- I’m not sure I agree.  
- I don’t really think so.  
- I see it differently.  
- I’m afraid I don’t agree.

Examples:  
- I’m not sure I agree. I think the situation is more complex.

## Reading – When People Disagree

Disagreement is a natural part of communication. People have different experiences, expectations and values, so it is normal that they see situations differently.

Problems often begin not because people disagree, but because they disagree in an aggressive or emotional way. When someone feels attacked, they stop listening. As a result, communication becomes about winning, not understanding.

Polite disagreement allows people to exchange ideas without damaging relationships. Expressions like *“I see your point, but…”* or *“I’m not sure I agree”* show respect and openness. They signal that a person is listening, even if they hold a different opinion.

In professional and personal life, the ability to disagree calmly is essential. It helps teams make better decisions, solve problems more effectively and create an environment where people feel safe to speak honestly.
