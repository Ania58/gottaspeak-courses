## Reading – When Silence Becomes a Choice

Many people believe that avoiding conflict keeps life easier. At work, in families, and in society, silence is often seen as a safe option. However, staying silent is also a decision – and it can have serious consequences.

Employees who never speak up about unfair treatment may protect themselves in the short term, but they also allow harmful systems to continue. Friends who turn a blind eye to problematic behaviour often do so to keep peace, yet their silence can feel like agreement.

Taking a stand does not always mean confrontation. It can mean calmly expressing concern, asking questions, or supporting someone who feels powerless. When people make their voices heard respectfully, they often create space for change.

Influence does not only belong to leaders. It exists wherever individuals choose not to give in to pressure and instead stand up for what they believe is right.
