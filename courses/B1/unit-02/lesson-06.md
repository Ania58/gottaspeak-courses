## Grammar Focus: Present Perfect vs Past Simple – Work Experience (7 min)

We often use the **present perfect** to talk about **work experience** when the exact time is not important or when the experience is connected to the present.

> I have worked in customer service for several years.  
> She has gained valuable experience in marketing.

We use the **past simple** when we talk about **specific jobs or moments in the past**, especially when the time is mentioned.

> I worked in a hotel in 2019.  
> He changed careers after the pandemic.

Very often, both tenses are used together when people talk about their career paths.

> I have had several jobs, but I started my current position last year.

## Reading: Changing Direction at Work (8 min)

For many adults, choosing a career is not a one-time decision. People often start working in one field and later realise that it does not meet their expectations. As a result, career changes have become more common than in the past.

Some people have stayed in the same job for years, but have never felt truly fulfilled. Others have taken the risk of changing direction, even after gaining a lot of experience. While the decision can be stressful, it often leads to greater job satisfaction.

Looking back, many career-changers say that the experience has helped them grow both professionally and personally. They have learned that it is never too late to rethink goals and take control of their career path.
