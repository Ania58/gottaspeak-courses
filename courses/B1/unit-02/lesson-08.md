## Reading: Success Without Burning Out (8 min)

In many modern workplaces, success is often measured by promotion, salary and responsibility. As a result, employees may feel pressure to work longer hours and take on more tasks in order to climb the career ladder.

However, constant pressure can lead to stress and burnout. Many professionals realise too late that working without balance affects both performance and personal life. Making ends meet is important, but so is protecting mental health.

Successful people are not only those who work the hardest, but also those who understand their limits, pull their weight as part of a team, and find time to rest and recover.
