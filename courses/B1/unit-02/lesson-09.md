## Grammar Focus: Second Conditional (7 min)

We use the **second conditional** to talk about **imaginary or unlikely situations** in the present or future and their results.

**Structure:**
- **If + past simple**, **would + base verb**

> If I had more experience, I would apply for that position.  
> If she worked fewer hours, she would feel less stressed.

Even though we use the **past simple**, we are **not talking about the past**.

We often use the second conditional to:
- talk about dreams and goals,
- give advice,
- imagine different life or career choices.

## Reading: What Would You Do If You Had the Choice? (8 min)

Many adults spend years following a career path they did not actively choose. Responsibilities, financial pressure and fear of failure often stop people from making changes. As a result, they imagine different possibilities but rarely act on them.

If people felt more confident and supported, they would be more willing to take chances. Some say they would start their own business, change careers or invest more time in personal goals. Others would simply reduce their working hours to improve their quality of life.

Although these situations are hypothetical, thinking about them can be useful. It helps people understand what truly matters to them and what changes they might want to make in the future.
