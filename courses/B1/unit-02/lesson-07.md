## Reading: When Responsibility Grows (8 min)

Taking on new responsibilities can be both exciting and challenging. Many employees are happy to accept more responsibility because it offers opportunities for growth and promotion. However, increased responsibility often comes with higher pressure and longer working hours.

Some people move up quickly and enjoy leadership roles, while others realise that the workload affects their work-life balance. In such cases, stepping down can be a difficult but healthy decision.

Whether people decide to stay, move up, or take over new projects, understanding their limits is essential. Carrying out responsibilities effectively requires not only skills but also self-awareness and support from others.
