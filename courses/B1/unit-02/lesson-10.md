## Reading: Choosing the Right Direction (8 min)

Making decisions about work and life goals is rarely simple. Many adults have gained experience over the years, yet still feel unsure about their next steps. Advice from others can be helpful, but it can also create pressure.

Some people follow advice too closely and end up unhappy. Others ignore it completely and face unnecessary risks. The key is to listen carefully, reflect on personal goals, and take responsibility for final decisions.

If people trusted their own experience more, they would feel more confident about their choices. Understanding that there is no single “right path” helps reduce stress and allows for healthier, more realistic goal-setting.
