## Language Focus – Reporting Decisions Without Naming People

Common structures:
- *It was decided that…*
- *It was agreed that…*

- *Someone was asked to…*
- *A decision was made to…*

Examples:
- *It was decided that the deadline would be extended.*

## Reading – After the Meeting

Following the management meeting, it was decided that several changes would be introduced. First, the review process was extended to allow more time for evaluation. It was also agreed that additional data would be collected before final approval.

During the discussion, concerns were raised about long-term impact. As a result, the proposal was not rejected, but further analysis was recommended. Staff were asked to submit feedback by the end of the week.

Although no individual opinions were mentioned in the final report, it was clear that the discussion had been intense. By using formal reporting language, the organisation ensured that the message remained professional and focused on next steps rather than disagreement.
