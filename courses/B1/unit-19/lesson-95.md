## Reading – When No One Steps Forward

After the incident, several statements were released. It was said that procedures had not been followed correctly and that improvements would be introduced. No names were mentioned, and no clear explanation was offered.

Internally, frustration grew. Team members felt that without clear accountability, the same problems would happen again. Some believed that protecting individuals was necessary to maintain cooperation, while others argued that honesty mattered more.

Eventually, a senior manager addressed the issue directly. She admitted that the situation had been handled poorly and took responsibility for the outcome. Her statement did not solve every problem, but it restored a sense of trust.

The contrast was clear: avoiding blame may reduce tension in the short term, but taking responsibility builds credibility in the long run.
