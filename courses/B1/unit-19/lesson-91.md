## Warm-up – Reading Between the Lines

Look at the statements and discuss:

1. “A mistake was made.”
2. “The decision has been taken.”
3. “Your request is being processed.”

Who is responsible in each case?  
Why do you think the speaker avoids saying **who** did it?

---

## Language Focus – Passive as a Communication Strategy

You already know **how** the passive is formed.  
Now we focus on **why it is used**.

Passive structures are common when:
- responsibility is unclear or shared
- the speaker wants to avoid blame
- the message needs to sound neutral or formal

Examples:
- “The deadline was missed.”  
- “Changes have been approved.”  
- “Further action will be taken.”

These sentences **hide the agent** on purpose.

## Vocabulary Focus – Responsibility & Accountability

Key vocabulary:

- responsibility  
- accountability  
- error

- face the consequences

## Reading – When Nobody Is to Blame

After the system failure, staff were informed that an error had occurred. No explanation was provided, and no individual was mentioned.

Later, it was announced that new procedures would be introduced. Training sessions were scheduled, and users were advised to remain patient. Once again, responsibility was implied but never clearly stated.

Some employees felt frustrated. Without knowing who had made the mistake, it was difficult to trust that the problem would not happen again. Others believed the approach was necessary to maintain cooperation and avoid conflict.

In many organisations, this type of language is used deliberately. By focusing on actions instead of people, communication remains professional — but accountability can become blurred.

## Reading Comprehension

1. What happened after the system failure?
2. How was responsibility communicated?
3. Why did some employees feel frustrated?
4. What is the advantage of this communication style?
5. What risk does it create?

---

## Grammar in Context – Interpreting Meaning

Look at the sentences. Decide what they **suggest**, not what they **say**.

1. “The procedure was not followed correctly.”  
2. “Several steps were overlooked.”  
3. “The issue is being addressed.”

For each sentence:
- Is responsibility clear or unclear?
- Is the tone neutral, defensive, or diplomatic?

---

## Practice – Improve the Communication

Rewrite the sentences to make them **more transparent**.

1. “A mistake was made during the process.”  
2. “The delay was caused by technical issues.”  
3. “The decision was taken without consultation.”

(You may use active or passive – choose what is clearer.)

---

## Speaking Task – Explaining What Happened

Describe a situation where:
- something went wrong
- responsibility was unclear
- communication made the situation better or worse

Use:
- at least one passive structure
- one expression related to responsibility

---

## Writing Task

Write **160–190 words**:

**“Why responsibility is often hidden in formal communication.”**

Include:
- examples of passive language
- vocabulary from the lesson
- your opinion on whether this is effective or problematic
