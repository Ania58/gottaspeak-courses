## Warm-up – Linking Actions and Outcomes

Discuss:

1. When something fails, what do people usually explain first: the cause or the result?
2. Why is it important to separate reasons from consequences?
3. In professional communication, what sounds more convincing: excuses or clear explanations?

---

## Language Focus – Cause & Result in Real Communication

At B1, we move beyond *because* and *so*.  
We use **cause–result structures** to sound clearer and more professional.

### Common patterns

- **X led to Y**
- **X resulted in Y**
- **Y happened due to X**
- **As a result, Y occurred**

Examples:
- Poor communication **led to** delays.
- The error **resulted in** customer complaints.
- The meeting was cancelled **due to** technical issues.
- **As a result**, the project timeline was revised.

## Reading – How Small Issues Turn Into Major Problems

The project did not fail because of one serious mistake. Instead, a series of small issues created a chain reaction that eventually caused major disruption.

The first problem appeared when internal updates were not shared consistently. As a result, several team members worked with outdated information. This led to incorrect assumptions and unnecessary rework.

Later, the lack of coordination resulted in missed approvals. Because these delays were not addressed early, pressure increased across departments. In the final stage, the situation escalated, and client confidence was affected.

Looking back, managers realised that most of the problems could have been prevented. Clear communication and early intervention would have reduced the impact of each issue and broken the chain before it grew.

## Reading Comprehension

1. Why didn’t the project fail because of one single mistake?
2. What was the first issue mentioned?
3. How did early problems affect later stages?
4. What consequence did the situation have for clients?
5. What lesson does the text suggest?

---

## Grammar in Context – Cause or Result?

Identify whether the highlighted part expresses a **cause (C)** or a **result (R)**.

1. The delay occurred **due to missing approvals**.  
2. **As a result**, customer trust decreased.  
3. Poor coordination **led to confusion**.  
4. The system failure was **the result of outdated software**.

---

## Practice – Improving Explanations

Rewrite the sentences to make the **cause–result relationship clearer**.

1. The meeting was cancelled. There were technical problems.  
2. Communication was unclear. Several tasks were repeated.  
3. Deadlines were missed. Pressure increased across the team.

(Use different connectors in each sentence.)
