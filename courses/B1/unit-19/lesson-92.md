## Warm-up – Talking About Mistakes

1. When something goes wrong, who usually gets blamed?
2. Is it easier to talk about mistakes directly or indirectly? Why?
3. In what situations is it better *not* to name the person responsible?

## Language Focus – Past Passive in Explanations

You already know the past passive form.  
Here we focus on **how it is used to explain past problems**.

Examples:
- The file **was deleted** by mistake.
- The deadline **was missed** due to poor communication.
- Important information **was not shared** on time.

This type of language:
- shifts attention to the event
- reduces personal confrontation
- is common in reports, emails and official explanations

## Reading – After the Deadline Was Missed

The project was expected to finish by the end of March, but the deadline was missed by almost three weeks. No official explanation was given at first.

Later, it was revealed that several documents had not been approved on time. Emails were sent late, and important updates were overlooked. Although the issues were eventually resolved, the delay caused frustration among clients.

Internally, a review was conducted. New guidelines were introduced, and staff were reminded of their responsibilities. However, no individual was publicly blamed for the failure.

While the situation was handled professionally, some employees felt that avoiding responsibility completely could create similar problems in the future. Without clear accountability, mistakes risk being repeated.

## Reading Comprehension

1. What problem occurred in the project?
2. What reasons were later given for the delay?
3. How did the organisation respond?
4. Why were some employees dissatisfied?
5. What risk does the text highlight?

---

## Grammar in Context – Interpreting Responsibility

Look at the sentences from the text.

1. “The deadline was missed.”  
2. “Several documents had not been approved.”  
3. “New guidelines were introduced.”

For each sentence, answer:
- Is responsibility clear or unclear?
- Who *might* have been responsible?
- Why is the passive used here?

---

## Practice – Choosing the Right Tone

Rewrite the sentences twice:
- version A: neutral / diplomatic  
- version B: more direct and transparent  

1. “The report was not completed on time.”  
2. “The information was not shared correctly.”  

Compare the effect of each version.
