## Grammar Focus: Reported Speech – Questions

When we report questions, we **do not use question word order**.
The sentence becomes a **statement**.

### Yes / No questions
- **asked if / whether**

> “Are you satisfied with the results?”  
> → She asked **if** I was satisfied with the results.

### Wh- questions
- **asked + question word**

> “Why did you resign?”  
> → They asked **why** he had resigned.

### Important changes
- no **do / does / did**
- no question mark
- tense usually goes **one step back**

> “What are you planning to do?”  
> → He asked what I **was planning** to do.

## Reading: How Interviews Become News Reports

Interviews are one of the main sources of information in journalism, but readers rarely see them in their original form. Instead of presenting every question and answer, reporters usually select the most relevant points and report them indirectly.

When journalists report interviews, questions are often transformed into statements. This helps create a smoother narrative and avoids repetition. For example, instead of writing *“The reporter asked, ‘Why did you resign?’”*, a news article might say that the official was asked why he had resigned.

Reported questions also allow journalists to highlight certain themes. If several questions focus on responsibility or mistakes, the report may emphasise public concern. The way questions are reported can shape how readers understand the interview and the importance of specific issues.

At the same time, this process involves interpretation. By choosing which questions to include and how to report them, journalists influence the overall message. Readers should therefore remember that reported interviews are summaries, not full records of what was said. Understanding reported questions helps readers recognise this layer of interpretation.
