## Practice 1 – Transform the Language

Rewrite using reported speech.

1. “We didn’t hide any information,” the spokesperson said.  
2. “Will you publish the full report?” the journalist asked.  
3. “I can explain the decision,” the manager said.  
4. “Why wasn’t the public informed earlier?” they asked.

   (admitted / claimed)

2. The company __________ that further measures would follow.  
   (denied / promised)

3. Experts __________ that the situation could worsen.  
   (suggested / admitted)

4. The minister __________ the accusations strongly.  
   (explained / denied)

## Reading: From Opinion to News Story

When opinions are shared publicly, they often go through several stages before reaching a wider audience. A personal comment may be repeated, summarised and eventually reported as part of a news story. During this process, the original words are rarely used. Instead, journalists rely on reported speech and reporting verbs to convey meaning.

This transformation helps media outlets maintain distance. By reporting what someone said rather than quoting them directly, journalists reduce emotional impact and potential legal risks. However, this distance can also lead to changes in tone. A strong opinion may appear weaker when reported, while a vague comment may sound more definite.

Another challenge is context. When statements are taken out of context, readers may believe that speakers said something they did not intend. This is why public figures often complain that words were put in their mouth or that comments were misunderstood. Attempts to clear up such misunderstandings sometimes come too late.

For readers, understanding how opinions become reports is essential. Recognising reported speech, identifying reporting verbs and reading between the lines help people form more accurate interpretations. Media literacy depends not only on what is said, but on how it is reported.
