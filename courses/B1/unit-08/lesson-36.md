## Grammar Focus: Reported Speech – Statements

We use **reported speech** to say **what someone said**, without using their exact words.

### Basic structure
- **said (that)** / **told + object (that)**

### Tense changes (most common)

- present simple → past simple  
  *“I work long hours.”* → He said that he worked long hours.

- present continuous → past continuous  
  *“We are reviewing the case.”* → They said they were reviewing the case.

- will → would  
  *“We will make a decision soon.”* → They said they would make a decision soon.

- can → could  
  *“I can confirm the report.”* → She said she could confirm the report.

👉 We usually change tenses because we are reporting something **from the past**.

## Reading: How Statements Are Reported in the Media

When public figures speak, their words rarely reach the audience exactly as they were said. Instead, journalists select key points and report them in a way that fits the wider context of the story. This process involves summarising, paraphrasing and sometimes reorganising information.

In official news reports, statements are often introduced with verbs such as *said*, *explained* or *confirmed*. These verbs help the reader understand the speaker’s attitude and level of certainty. For example, when a spokesperson admits a mistake, it signals responsibility, while denying an allegation suggests disagreement or rejection.

Reported speech also allows journalists to maintain distance. Rather than directly quoting emotional or controversial language, they can present information more neutrally. This approach reduces the risk of misinterpretation and helps maintain objectivity, especially in sensitive situations.

However, reporting statements also carries responsibility. If words are taken out of context or summarised inaccurately, the original meaning may change. For this reason, readers should be aware that reported speech reflects interpretation as well as information. Understanding how statements are reported helps people read the news more critically and recognise subtle shifts in meaning.
