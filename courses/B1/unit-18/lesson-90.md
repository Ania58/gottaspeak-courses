## Reading – The Choice Nobody Wanted to Make

The company had reached a turning point. Profits were falling, deadlines were being missed, and morale was low. Everyone agreed that something had to change — but no one agreed on what.

Some managers believed that if the company invested more in training, performance would improve. Others argued that if costs were reduced, the business would survive the year. Each option had consequences, and none felt safe.

The problem wasn’t the lack of ideas, but the fear of responsibility. If someone made the wrong choice, they would be blamed. As a result, decisions were delayed, and the situation worsened.

In the end, the company learned a hard lesson: if decisions are avoided, consequences still happen — just without control.
