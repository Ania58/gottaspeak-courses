## Warm-up – Making Sense of Situations

Look at the situations and discuss:

1. You arrive at work and all the lights are on, but no one is there.
2. A colleague hasn’t replied to your email for three days.
3. Your train is late, but there is no announcement.

What **could**, **might**, or **must** be happening in each case?

## Grammar Focus – Modal Verbs of Deduction

We use modal verbs to **guess or deduce** what is happening or what happened.

### ➤ Present deduction

- **must** → almost certain  
- **might / could** → possible  
- **can’t** → impossible  

Examples:
- She **must be** in a meeting – her calendar is full.
- They **might be** working remotely today.
- He **can’t be** at home – his car isn’t there.

### ➤ Past deduction

- **must have + past participle**
- **might have + past participle**
- **can’t have + past participle**

Examples:
- He **must have forgotten** the deadline.
- They **might have misunderstood** the instructions.
- She **can’t have seen** the message – she replied immediately.

## Reading – When Assumptions Go Wrong

On Monday morning, the project team arrived to find their shared drive completely empty. Files were missing, folders were gone, and no explanation had been left behind.

At first, everyone assumed that the IT department must have made a serious error. Some employees even believed that an external attack had occurred. The tension in the room grew quickly, and accusations began to fly.

However, after a short investigation, it became clear that the situation was very different. A junior manager had tested a new system late on Friday and accidentally deleted the live data instead of a backup version. Because no one checked the system over the weekend, the issue went unnoticed.

The incident highlighted how quickly people jump to conclusions when information is limited. Instead of examining the evidence calmly, the team allowed stress and assumptions to take control. As a result, trust was temporarily damaged, even though the problem itself was easy to fix.

---

## Reading Comprehension

1. What did the team initially believe had happened?
2. What was the real cause of the problem?
3. Why did the situation escalate so quickly?
4. What lesson does the incident highlight?
5. How could the team have handled the situation differently?

## Grammar Practice – What Probably Happened?

Rewrite the sentences using **must / might / can’t**.

1. I’m almost sure she misunderstood the email.  
2. It’s possible they ignored the warning.  
3. I’m certain he didn’t know about the change.  
4. It’s very likely the system failed overnight.
