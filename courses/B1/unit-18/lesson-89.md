## Reading – The Decision That Changed Everything

When Marta turned thirty, she realised she was stuck in a job she no longer believed in. She remembered choosing it because it felt safe, not because it felt right.

One evening, after another long day, she stopped to think about what she actually wanted. She tried listing the reasons to stay, but none of them felt convincing. Then she tried changing her routine, hoping that small adjustments would make a difference. They didn’t.

Eventually, she decided to stop doing what was expected of her and start taking responsibility for her own choices. She remembers feeling terrified the day she resigned, but she also remembers feeling free.

Looking back, Marta doesn’t regret leaving. What she regrets is waiting so long to act. Sometimes, avoiding a decision is the biggest risk of all.
