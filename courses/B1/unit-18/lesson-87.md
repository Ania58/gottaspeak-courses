## Warm-up – Not All Reasons Are Equal

Think and answer:

1. When someone tries to convince you, what makes a reason sound strong?
2. Have you ever heard an argument that sounded good at first, but wasn’t convincing?
3. Do you usually question reasons people give, or accept them easily?

---

## Language Focus – Strong vs Weak Reasons

At B1 level, learners should start to **judge reasons**, not just give them.

### Strong reasons often:
- are specific  
- include consequences  
- are connected to real situations  

### Weak reasons often:
- are vague  
- depend only on feelings  
- don’t explain results  

Compare:

- *I like it, so it’s good.* ❌ (weak)  
- *It saves time and reduces stress, which makes it more effective.* ✅ (strong)

## Useful Language – Explaining Reasons

- one reason is that …
- this is because …
- as a result …
- which means that …
- the main issue is …

**Idioms / phrasal verbs (natural use):**
- **back something up** (support with reasons)
- **fall apart** (when an argument stops making sense)
- **point out** (draw attention to a reason)

## Controlled Practice – Choose the Best Completion

1. His argument sounded convincing at first, but it __________ when we asked for details.  
   (fell apart / backed it up)

2. One reason people avoid change is __________ fear of failure.  
   (because of / although)

3. She managed to __________ her opinion with real examples.  
   (point out / back up)

4. The plan failed, __________ nobody checked the costs in advance.  
   (as a result / because)

5. He raised an interesting point, __________ it didn’t solve the main problem.  
   (however / because)

## Reading – When Reasons Don’t Hold Up

People often accept arguments without questioning them. A confident tone or emotional language can make weak reasons sound strong. However, once people start asking *why* and *how*, many arguments fall apart.

For example, someone may say that a company should return to the office because “that’s how things used to work.” While this sounds familiar, it does not explain why the old system is better. Without evidence or consequences, the reason remains weak.

Stronger arguments usually explain results. They show what will change and why it matters. When people back up their ideas with examples, data or clear outcomes, their message becomes more persuasive.

Learning to recognise weak reasoning helps people make better decisions. It also allows them to respond calmly instead of reacting emotionally.

## Reading Comprehension

1. Why do people sometimes accept weak arguments?
2. What example of a weak reason is mentioned?
3. What makes an argument stronger?
4. Why is questioning reasons important?
5. Do you think people do this often in real life?

---

## Reasoning Practice – Identify the Problem

Each sentence has a **weak or unclear reason**. Rewrite it to make it stronger.

1. This rule should stay because it feels right.  
2. We shouldn’t change the system because people don’t like change.  
3. Remote work is bad because I prefer the office.

## Speaking Task – Testing Reasons

Choose one topic and discuss it aloud:

- returning to the office full-time  
- banning phones at work or school  
- changing working hours  

For each topic:
- give one **weak reason**
- then improve it into a **strong reason**

---

## Writing Task

Write **150–180 words**:

**“A common argument that doesn’t convince me – and why.”**

Include:
- at least 3 reason connectors  
- one idiom or phrasal verb from the lesson  
- a clear explanation of why the argument is weak
