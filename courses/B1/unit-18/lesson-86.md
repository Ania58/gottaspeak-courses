## Reading – Speaking Up in Modern Life

In many areas of life, people are expected to share their opinions. At work, employees are often asked to give feedback, suggest ideas, or express concerns. In social situations, opinions shape conversations, friendships and decisions.

However, speaking up is not always easy. Some people worry that their opinion might be unpopular or misunderstood. Others prefer to listen rather than talk. As a result, many ideas remain unspoken.

Clear opinion language helps reduce this problem. When people say “In my opinion” or “From my point of view,” they show respect for different perspectives. This makes discussions more open and productive.

Learning how to express opinions confidently is not about winning arguments. It is about communicating ideas clearly and taking part in meaningful conversations.
