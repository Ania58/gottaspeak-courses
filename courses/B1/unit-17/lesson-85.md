## Language Focus – Describing Problems and Solutions

We often talk about **problems → consequences → solutions**.

Useful patterns:

- If + present, **will** + result  
- If this happens, the result **will be**…  
- One solution is to…  
- A better option would be to…

Examples:

- If the issue isn’t solved early, it will get worse.  
- One solution is to improve communication.

## Reading – When Problems Are Left Unsolved

In many organisations, problems don’t appear suddenly. They develop slowly over time.

At first, small mistakes are often ignored. Managers may think the situation will improve on its own. However, if nobody **steps in**, confusion increases.

When employees feel that issues are being ignored, motivation drops. If communication breaks down, misunderstandings grow. Over time, pressure builds and people begin to blame each other.

The most effective solution is usually simple: act early. If leaders **take responsibility** and **deal with** problems quickly, trust can be rebuilt. Clear communication and realistic planning often prevent conflicts from escalating.

Ignoring problems rarely makes them disappear. In most cases, it only makes the solution more difficult later.
