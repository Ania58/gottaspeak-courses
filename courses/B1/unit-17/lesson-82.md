## Reading – When One Change Affects Everything

A large retail company decided to reduce staff in order to cut costs. At first, the decision seemed reasonable. However, the consequences were more serious than expected.

Fewer employees meant longer waiting times in stores. As a result, customer satisfaction dropped quickly. Negative reviews increased online, and sales declined.

The situation created a **knock-on effect**. Because staff were under pressure, mistakes became more frequent. Small errors **turned into** larger problems. Eventually, the company had to spend more money fixing issues than it had saved.

The original decision **backfired**. Instead of improving profits, it damaged the company’s reputation. In the end, management realised that short-term savings sometimes lead to long-term losses.

This example shows how one change can **set off** a chain reaction that affects every part of an organisation.
