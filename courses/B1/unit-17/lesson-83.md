Daniel started a new job in a fast-growing company. At first, he was excited. The salary was good and the team seemed ambitious.

However, the workload was **so heavy that** he barely had time to rest. He was under **such intense pressure that** he stopped seeing his friends and family.

The deadlines were **so tight that** he had to work every weekend. The stress became **such a constant part of his life that** he didn’t even notice how exhausted he was.

Looking back, Daniel realised the company had grown so quickly that management couldn’t support employees properly. The system was under **such strain that** failure was almost inevitable.
