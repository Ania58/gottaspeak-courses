Examples:

- If we **ignore** the issue, it **will get** worse.  
- When people **don’t communicate**, problems **will appear**.

👉 *If* focuses on possibility.  
👉 *When* suggests something is likely.

## Reading – What Happens If We Do Nothing?

A company notices small problems in customer service. At first, managers think they will disappear on their own.

However, if they **don’t deal with** complaints quickly, customers become frustrated. When clients feel ignored, they **will stop** trusting the brand.

If negative reviews increase, sales **will drop**. As profits fall, budgets are cut. When teams lose support, motivation **falls apart**.

One small issue can **run into** another, and the situation can quickly **get out of hand**. If management waits too long, the company **will end up** spending more money fixing problems than preventing them.

The lesson is simple: if you fix issues early, you avoid bigger consequences later.
