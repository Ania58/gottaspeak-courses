## Grammar Review – Expressing Reasons and Contrast

We often explain **why something happens** or **why a decision is made**.

### Giving reasons
- **because** – clear reason  
- **since** – reason that is already known  

> I left early **because** I felt sick.  
> **Since** it was Sunday, the shop closed early.

### Showing contrast
- **although / even though** – contrast, unexpected result  

> I worked from home, **although** I wasn’t in the office.  
> **Even though** he drives slowly, he wanted to go by car.
