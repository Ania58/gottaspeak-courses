All three introduce a reason.

- We cancelled the meeting **because** the manager was ill.  
- **Since** traffic was heavy, we arrived late.

## Reading – Case Study: Why the Project Failed

Last year, a small technology company launched a new mobile app. At first, expectations were high. However, the project failed after only six months.

The main problem started because the team rushed development. Since they wanted to release the app quickly, they skipped important testing stages. As a result, users experienced technical problems immediately.

The negative reviews **set off** a chain reaction. Downloads decreased sharply because of poor ratings in the app store. Sales dropped due to customer dissatisfaction.

Poor communication also **contributed to** the failure. Different departments worked separately, and misunderstandings **led to** repeated mistakes. Small issues slowly **spiralled out of control**.

In the end, the company had to remove the app from the market. The failure wasn’t caused by one single mistake. Instead, it was **brought about** by several small problems that built up over time.
