**Examples:**
- The law **is introduced** next month.

## Reading: A Neutral Way to Inform

In news reporting, information is often presented in a neutral and factual way. The passive voice is commonly used to focus attention on events rather than individuals. This style helps journalists avoid personal opinions and keeps the report objective.

Important decisions are announced daily, and new measures are introduced by authorities around the world. In many cases, the people responsible are not mentioned, either because they are unknown or because the event itself matters more.

By using the passive voice, news reports sound formal and reliable. Readers are encouraged to focus on what has happened, not on who caused it. This approach supports clarity and professionalism in journalism.
