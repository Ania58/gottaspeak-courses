## Reading: Interview Excerpt

**Interviewer:**  
Do you think the public was told the whole story?

**Expert:**  
Not at first. Certain details were left out, and responsibility was shifted. Instead of addressing the problem, some officials tried to sweep it under the carpet.

**Interviewer:**  
Will the truth come out eventually?

**Expert:**  
It usually does. Once evidence is backed up by facts and people speak out, it becomes harder to cover things up.
