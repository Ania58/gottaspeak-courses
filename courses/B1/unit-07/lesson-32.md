## Grammar Focus: Passive Voice – Past Simple

The **passive voice in the past simple** is used to report **completed events** when:
- the action is more important than the person,
- the person is unknown, obvious or not relevant,
- the report needs to sound neutral and factual.

**Form:**
- **was / were + past participle**

**Examples:**
- The decision **was made** last night.  
- The suspect **was arrested** yesterday.  
- Several buildings **were damaged** during the storm.

**Compare:**
- *Police arrested the suspect.* (active)  
- *The suspect was arrested.* (passive)

## Reading: Breaking News and Objectivity

Breaking news reports focus on facts and events that have already happened. In these situations, the passive voice is often used to keep the information clear and objective. This allows journalists to describe events without speculation or personal judgement.

After an incident occurs, details are collected and confirmed. Roads are closed, investigations are launched and statements are released. At this stage, the identity of those responsible may not be known, or it may be inappropriate to share names.

Using the passive voice helps news organisations report responsibly. It ensures that attention stays on what happened, when it happened and how it affects the public, rather than on unconfirmed details.
