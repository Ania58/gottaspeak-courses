## Reading: When Communication Breaks Down (16–18 min)

Even strong relationships experience moments of tension. People may get along well for years and then suddenly fall out because of a misunderstanding or unmet expectations. When communication breaks down, emotions often replace reason.

Many conflicts become serious because people avoid talking openly. Instead of talking things over, they remain silent or react defensively. Over time, unresolved issues create distance and frustration. Learning to open up can feel uncomfortable, but it is essential for rebuilding trust.

Healthy communication requires effort from both sides. Compromise, respect and patience help people sort out disagreements without damaging the relationship. Making up after a conflict does not mean forgetting what happened, but understanding it better.

Relationships grow stronger when people learn how to manage conflict constructively. Honest conversations can transform tension into deeper connection and mutual understanding.
