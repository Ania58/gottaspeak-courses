## Grammar Focus: Past Simple vs Present Perfect (8 min)

We use **past simple** to talk about **finished events in the past**, especially when we say *when* something happened.

> I met my best friend ten years ago.  
> We had a serious argument last year.

We use **present perfect** to talk about **experiences and changes** without saying exactly *when*.

> I’ve had difficult relationships in the past.  
> She’s learned a lot from previous conflicts.

### Compare:

- **Past Simple** → *when / finished time*  
- **Present Perfect** → *experience / result now*

## Reading: How Experiences Shape Relationships (16–18 min)

Relationships rarely stay the same throughout life. As people grow older, their experiences influence how they communicate, react and connect with others. Friendships, family relationships and romantic partnerships all develop through shared moments, both positive and challenging.

Many adults have experienced misunderstandings or conflicts that taught them important lessons. Some have learned to listen more carefully, while others have realised the importance of setting boundaries. These experiences often lead to more mature communication and deeper emotional awareness.

At the same time, past events can affect present behaviour. People who have faced repeated conflict may become cautious or avoid difficult conversations. However, recognising these patterns can help improve future relationships. Reflecting on past experiences allows individuals to build healthier connections.

Strong relationships are not based on perfection, but on growth. When people learn from what has happened before, they are better prepared to communicate openly and respectfully in the present.
