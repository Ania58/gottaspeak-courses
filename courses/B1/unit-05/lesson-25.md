## Reading: Building Stronger Relationships Through Communication (18–20 min)

Healthy communication is one of the most important elements of strong relationships. Over time, many adults have realised that misunderstandings often come from poor listening rather than bad intentions. Learning to communicate clearly requires patience, awareness and effort.

People have experienced different communication styles in their lives. Some grew up in environments where emotions were openly discussed, while others learned to keep things to themselves. These past experiences influence how people express feelings today. However, communication habits are not fixed and can change.

Effective communication involves both speaking and listening. Talking things over after conflict helps people understand each other’s perspectives. Avoiding blame, setting boundaries and choosing the right moment to speak reduce tension and prevent people from losing their temper.

Relationships improve when individuals commit to honest dialogue and mutual respect. By recognising patterns, making conscious choices and remaining open to growth, people can build deeper and more supportive connections.
