## Reading: Advice in a Culture of Constant Pressure (16–18 min)

Modern life often comes with endless advice. People are told how to eat, how to exercise, how to work and even how to relax. While much of this advice is helpful, it can also feel overwhelming.

In a culture that values productivity, people sometimes ignore simple recommendations. They work long hours, sleep too little and push themselves too hard. As a result, stress-related problems become more common. Many experts agree that people should pay more attention to basic needs such as rest, movement and social connection.

Giving advice requires sensitivity. Telling someone what they ought to do can sound judgmental if it is not done with care. The most effective advice focuses on support rather than criticism. Encouraging small, realistic changes often leads to better results than demanding perfection.

Understanding when to give advice—and how to receive it—is an important part of maintaining healthy relationships and balanced lifestyles.
