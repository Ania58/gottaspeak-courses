## Reading: Living in a World That Never Slows Down (16–18 min)

Modern life is often described as fast-paced and demanding. Many adults feel constant pressure to be productive, available and successful. As a result, stress has become a common part of everyday life.

People are increasingly aware that ignoring stress can lead to exhaustion and health problems. Some have started to slow down by changing their routines, cutting out unnecessary commitments and spending more time resting. Others have taken up physical activity to work out tension and clear their minds.

However, managing stress is not only about individual choices. Work culture, social expectations and technology all influence how people live. Learning to deal with pressure requires setting boundaries and recognising personal limits. Giving up unhealthy habits and looking after mental health are essential steps toward long-term wellbeing.

Finding balance in a world that never seems to stop is challenging, but small, consistent changes can make a meaningful difference.
