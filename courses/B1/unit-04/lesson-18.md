## Reading: When Rest Becomes a Necessity (16–18 min)

In modern society, being busy is often seen as a sign of success. Many adults feel pressure to stay productive, respond quickly and meet high expectations. As a result, rest is sometimes treated as a luxury rather than a necessity.

Over time, constantly running on empty can lead to burnout. People may ignore warning signs such as tiredness, lack of motivation or frequent illness. When this happens, both mental and physical health suffer. Feeling under the weather becomes normal instead of a signal to slow down.

More people are starting to recognise the importance of balance. Taking time to recharge your batteries is no longer viewed as weakness, but as part of responsible self-care. Short breaks, setting boundaries and learning to take it easy can improve focus, mood and long-term wellbeing.

Understanding personal limits helps prevent exhaustion and supports healthier lifestyles. In a world that values constant activity, choosing rest can be a powerful and necessary decision.
