## Reading: When Information Shapes Reality (18–20 min)

In today’s digital world, information travels faster than ever before. News spreads within seconds, often without verification. As a result, people are constantly exposed to headlines that influence opinions, emotions and decisions.

If readers do not check sources, misinformation can quickly become accepted as truth. Social media platforms amplify this effect by rewarding content that attracts attention rather than accuracy. When misleading stories are shared repeatedly, they shape public opinion and affect how people view events, institutions and even each other.

Media influence is not always intentional. Journalists and content creators face pressure to publish quickly, and mistakes happen. However, if accuracy is ignored, trust in media declines. Once credibility is lost, it is difficult to rebuild.

Critical reading is therefore essential. If individuals question information, compare sources and read beyond headlines, they become less vulnerable to manipulation. Responsible media consumption does not eliminate bias completely, but it reduces its impact and supports a more informed society.
