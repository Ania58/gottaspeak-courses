## Reading: For and Against – Sharing Opinions Online

### FOR

Sharing opinions online allows people to participate in public discussion. It gives individuals a voice and helps spread awareness about important issues. If people express their views respectfully, discussions can lead to social change and better understanding. Open debate encourages diversity of perspectives and helps challenge misinformation.

### AGAINST

However, expressing opinions online also has risks. Many people share content without reading it carefully or checking sources. If opinions are based on incomplete or misleading information, they can reinforce false beliefs. Emotional reactions often replace facts, and meaningful discussion becomes difficult.

### CONCLUSION

Forming responsible opinions requires effort. If individuals take time to read between the lines, question sources and consider different perspectives, online discussions can become more constructive. Without this awareness, public debate may do more harm than good.
