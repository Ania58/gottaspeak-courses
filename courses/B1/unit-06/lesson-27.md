## Grammar Focus: Second Conditional (8 min)

We use the **second conditional** to talk about **imaginary or unlikely situations** and their **hypothetical results**.

**Structure:**
- **If + past simple**, **would / could / might + base verb**

> If people were more critical, fake news wouldn’t spread so easily.  
> If I didn’t use social media, I’d feel less overwhelmed.

### Key points:
- The situation is **not real** or **not very likely**.
- It is used to express **opinions, wishes and speculation**.
- It helps us create distance and think abstractly.

## Reading: A World That Questions Information 

Imagine a world in which people did not immediately believe everything they read online. If readers stopped and reflected before sharing content, public conversations would become calmer and more thoughtful. Emotional reactions would give way to analysis and discussion.

In this imagined reality, individuals would be more aware of how media influences opinions. They would recognise bias, question assumptions and seek multiple perspectives. If this approach were common, sensational headlines would lose their power.

Of course, this world does not fully exist. Many people still rely on quick information and instant reactions. However, if critical thinking were taught more effectively, attitudes could change over time. Education would focus not only on consuming information, but on evaluating it.

The future of media literacy depends on choice. If society invested more effort in awareness and responsibility, public discourse would become more balanced and trustworthy.
