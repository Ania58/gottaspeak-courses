## Grammar Focus – will (Decisions Now)

We use **will** for:

### ➤ decisions made at the moment of speaking
- OK, I’ll call them now.
- I’ll help you.

### ➤ offers
- I’ll carry that for you.
- I’ll send the email.

### ➤ promises
- I’ll be on time.
- Don’t worry, I won’t forget.

### ➤ predictions (opinions)
- I think it will be difficult.
- This will probably work.
