## Reading – A Career Reset Plan

Mark works in customer support, but he feels stuck. Every day is the same, and he doesn’t see many opportunities to grow. Instead of complaining, he decides to make a plan.

First, he’s going to update his CV and LinkedIn profile. Then he’s going to take an online course in data analysis because he wants to change departments. He’s also going to speak to his manager about internal opportunities.

Mark knows it won’t happen immediately. He isn’t going to quit his job without a plan. Instead, he’s going to prepare carefully and apply for new positions over the next six months.

For him, planning makes the future feel less stressful and more realistic.
