## Reading – Three Small Decisions, Three Big Results

Sometimes small daily choices create big consequences.

### Situation 1 – The Course
Marta sees an online course that could improve her skills. It starts tomorrow.  
If she registers today, she will get a discount. If she waits, the price will increase.  
She isn’t sure she has time, but she knows the certificate might help her find a better job.

### Situation 2 – The Meeting
Alex has an important meeting at 9:00 a.m.  
If he wakes up late, he’ll miss the train. If he misses the train, he’ll arrive late.  
His manager could think he isn’t responsible.

### Situation 3 – The Health Check
Leo feels tired every day.  
He could ignore the problem, or he could see a doctor.  
If he continues working without rest, he might get sick.  
If he changes his routine, he may feel better quickly.

Small actions often lead to bigger results than we expect.
