## Warm-up – From People to Processes

Discuss:

1. When is it more important *what is done* than *who does it*?
2. Where do we often hear passive sentences (news, rules, instructions, work)?
3. Why do organisations use formal and impersonal language?

---

## Grammar Focus – Passive Voice

We use the **passive voice** when:

- the action is more important than the person  
- the person is unknown or obvious  
- we describe systems, rules, processes, services  

### Form

**Present simple passive**  
👉 am / is / are + past participle  
- The form is completed online.  
- Requests are processed within 48 hours.

**Past simple passive**  
👉 was / were + past participle  
- The system was updated last year.  
- The decision was made yesterday.

## Controlled Practice – Change to Passive

→ Applications __________________________.

2. The company provides training every month.  
→ Training __________________________.

→ The request __________________________.

4. They introduced new safety rules last year.  
→ New safety rules __________________________.

5. Someone reported the problem immediately.  
→ The problem __________________________.

## Reading – How Workplace Decisions Are Handled

In modern organisations, decisions are rarely made by one person alone. Instead, clear systems are established so that actions can be taken efficiently and responsibly.

When a request is submitted, it is first reviewed by the relevant department. If additional information is needed, the applicant is contacted and the request is temporarily placed on hold. Once all documents are received, the case is evaluated and a recommendation is prepared.

Important decisions are usually discussed in meetings where different perspectives are considered. After that, a final decision is made and the outcome is communicated to all parties involved. If the request is approved, the necessary steps are taken. If it is rejected, an explanation is provided.

This process ensures that responsibility is shared, mistakes are reduced and transparency is maintained. By focusing on what is done rather than who does it, organisations aim to create systems that are fair, clear and efficient.
