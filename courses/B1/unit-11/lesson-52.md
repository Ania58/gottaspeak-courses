- sound neutral and professional  
- focus on the process, not the person  
- describe systems, rules and expectations  

Examples:
- ID is required at reception.  
- The documents must be submitted online.  
- Complaints are handled within five working days.

## Reading – Public Service Guidelines

All visitors are required to register at reception upon arrival. A valid form of identification must be presented and a temporary access card is issued. This card must be worn at all times while inside the building.

Personal belongings are inspected for security reasons. Any prohibited items are removed and stored until departure. Visitors are informed of safety procedures and emergency exits are clearly marked.

Requests for access to restricted areas are reviewed individually. Permission is granted only if the purpose of the visit is considered necessary and appropriate. If access is denied, an explanation is provided by the administration office.

These procedures are designed to ensure safety, protect sensitive information and maintain professional standards throughout the organisation.
