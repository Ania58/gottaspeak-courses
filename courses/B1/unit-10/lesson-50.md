## Reading: The Message That Changed the Office

When Lina sent a short message to her manager late on a Friday evening, she did not expect it to matter. She simply wanted to postpone a difficult conversation. The message was polite, vague and carefully written. It was meant to delay tension, not create it.

But the message was forwarded. A colleague misunderstood its tone. By Monday morning, three departments were involved. What Lina saw as a harmless delay led to confusion, speculation and frustration. The situation quickly developed into a chain reaction.

Meetings were organised. Assumptions replaced explanations. A process that could have taken ten minutes turned into weeks of clarification. Lina’s attempt to avoid discomfort backfired. Instead of protecting relationships, it damaged trust.

Eventually, Lina asked for a meeting and explained everything. The tension slowly eased. The crisis did not disappear immediately, but it turned out to be a turning point. The organisation introduced clearer communication rules. Managers became more available. What began as a mistake brought about changes that might never have happened otherwise.

Lina had messed up. But by facing the consequences, she also helped create a better system.
