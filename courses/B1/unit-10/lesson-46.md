## Grammar Focus: Zero Conditional – Facts and Systems

We use the **zero conditional** to talk about things that are **always or usually true**.  
It describes **systems, routines, habits and natural consequences**.

### Form
**If / when / unless + present simple, present simple**

- If people **feel** ignored, they often **withdraw**.  
- When stress **builds up**, performance usually **drops**.  
- Unless companies **communicate** clearly, misunderstandings **increase**.

👉 We use the zero conditional for:
- social behaviour  
- work culture  
- psychology  
- rules of life  
- cause–effect patterns

## Reading: The Predictable Side of Human Behaviour

Although people like to believe their reactions are spontaneous, much of human behaviour follows recognisable patterns. When individuals experience the same emotional situations repeatedly, they usually develop predictable responses.

If people feel undervalued, motivation often decreases. When communication breaks down, assumptions replace facts. If effort is ignored, resentment tends to build. These reactions are not signs of weakness; they are natural psychological responses.

Workplace culture offers a clear example. When employees receive clear expectations and feedback, performance generally improves. If leadership avoids difficult conversations, problems usually spread quietly. Over time, silence becomes a system, and small issues grow into structural failures.

The zero conditional allows us to describe these mechanisms. It does not judge behaviour; it explains it. Understanding such patterns helps individuals recognise risks early and respond consciously rather than automatically.
