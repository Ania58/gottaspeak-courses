## Reading: Imagining Other Paths

At certain moments, people stop and imagine who they might be if they had made different choices. These reflections are rarely about small details. They involve careers not pursued, relationships not continued and risks not taken.

If people were less afraid of uncertainty, they might experiment more. They would change directions earlier, leave unsatisfying situations and explore unrealised interests. But fear of instability often limits alternatives. Stability offers comfort, even when it restricts fulfilment.

Hypothetical thinking is not escape. It allows distance. By imagining other paths, people gain perspective on their present one. If someone feels trapped, they may realise which conditions truly matter. If they imagine freedom, they might recognise which limitations are internal rather than external.

The second conditional gives language to these reflections. It expresses possibility without claiming reality. It helps people explore choices safely before deciding whether change is necessary.
