## Grammar Focus: First Conditional – Real Future Consequences

We use the **first conditional** to talk about **real and possible future situations** and their likely results.

### Form  
**If / when / unless + present simple, will / may / might + base form**

- If stress **continues**, performance **will decline**.  
- If people **don’t set** limits, they **may lose** control of their time.

👉 We use the first conditional for:
- predictions based on current situations  
- warnings and consequences

## Reading: The Cost of Ignoring Early Signs

Most serious problems do not appear suddenly. They develop quietly. Fatigue replaces energy. Motivation weakens. Small frustrations accumulate. At first, these changes are easy to ignore.

If a person continues working without rest, concentration will decline. If boundaries are not set, availability will expand until it becomes exhaustion. Unless warning signs are recognised early, physical and emotional limits may be reached unexpectedly.

Work environments often normalise overload. Long hours become proof of commitment. Constant stress is treated as ambition. However, if organisations reward only endurance, they risk creating cultures of burnout. Productivity may increase temporarily, but long-term outcomes will suffer.

The first conditional allows us to speak clearly about such futures. It connects present behaviour to future consequences. It reminds us that change is still possible. If people act in time, they can prevent damage. If they wait, recovery may take much longer.
