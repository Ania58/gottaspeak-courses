## Reading: Small Actions, Big Impact (8 min)

Social problems often feel too large for individuals to influence. However, history shows that change usually begins with people who speak up and take responsibility. When problems are ignored, they tend to grow.

Many environmental and social movements started with small actions. People pointed out problems, changed their behaviour, and encouraged others to do the same. Over time, these actions led to wider awareness and stronger pressure on institutions.

If societies continue to deal with problems openly and responsibly, long-term change becomes possible.
