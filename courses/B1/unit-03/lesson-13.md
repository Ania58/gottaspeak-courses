## Reading: Responsibility in a Changing Society (12–14 min)

Modern societies are changing rapidly, and these changes often bring new challenges. Technology, globalisation and social media influence how people communicate, work and form opinions. While these developments offer many benefits, they also create pressure to adapt quickly.

Many people feel that institutions and leaders are out of touch with everyday problems. When authorities turn a blind eye to issues such as inequality, mental health or environmental damage, trust in society can weaken. As a result, individuals often feel frustrated and powerless.

However, social change does not depend only on governments. Ordinary people can raise awareness by speaking openly, supporting campaigns or changing their daily habits. Even small actions, when repeated by many people, can make a difference.

Keeping up with the times does not mean abandoning all traditions. It means finding a balance between progress and responsibility. A society that encourages involvement and accountability is more likely to face challenges successfully.
