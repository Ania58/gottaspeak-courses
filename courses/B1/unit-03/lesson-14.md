## Grammar Focus: First Conditional + Cause & Effect (8 min)

We use the **first conditional** to talk about **real and possible future situations** and their results.

**Structure:**
- **If / When + present simple**, **will + base verb**

> If people change their habits, society will improve.  
> When governments invest in education, long-term results will appear.

To explain **causes and consequences**, we often use linking words and phrases:

- **because (of)**  
  > Problems grow because people ignore them.
- **as a result / therefore**  
  > Many people feel insecure; as a result, trust decreases.
- **due to**  
  > Social tension increases due to inequality.

These structures help make arguments clearer and more logical.

## Reading: From Awareness to Action (14–16 min)

Social problems rarely appear overnight. They usually develop slowly, as habits, attitudes and systems change over time. When people fail to recognise early warning signs, small issues can grow into serious challenges.

For example, if communities ignore rising inequality, frustration and social tension will increase. As a result, trust in institutions may weaken. Similarly, when education systems do not adapt to modern needs, young people may struggle to find meaningful opportunities later in life.

However, change is possible when problems are addressed early. If governments invest in education and social support, long-term outcomes will improve. When individuals take responsibility for their actions and communities cooperate, solutions become more realistic and sustainable.

Understanding cause and effect helps societies move from awareness to action. Rather than turning a blind eye, people can focus on prevention, cooperation and shared responsibility.
