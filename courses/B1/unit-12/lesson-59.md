- above all…  
- not only … but also…  
- what is really important is…

### ➤ Adding and structuring
- in fact  
- actually  
- what is more  
- on top of that  
- to some extent

## Reading – Why Systems Succeed or Fail

When organisations change, the technical side usually receives most attention. However, what really determines success is often human behaviour.

The main reason many reforms fail is not poor design, but resistance. People struggle when familiar structures are replaced. From their perspective, stability feels safer than improvement.

What is more, communication is frequently underestimated. New procedures may be logical, but if they are not explained clearly, uncertainty spreads. In fact, confusion often creates more disruption than the change itself.

Above all, successful systems recognise emotional responses. Not only are processes redesigned, but support is also provided. When people feel included, adaptation becomes easier and long-term results improve.
