## Warm-up – Adding Information

Discuss:

1. How do people usually add details when they describe someone or something?
2. Why is it useful to combine information into one sentence?
3. Where do we often hear long descriptive sentences (news, reports, stories)?

## Grammar Focus – Relative Clauses

Relative clauses allow us to **add information** about people, things, places and ideas.

### ➤ Defining relative clauses  
(give essential information)

- who / that → people  
- which / that → things  
- where → places  

Examples:  
- This is the company **that provides online services**.  
- She is the manager **who leads the team**.

### ➤ Non-defining relative clauses  
(give extra information – commas needed)

- who / which / where  
- NOT “that”

Examples:  
- The new system, **which was introduced last year**, improved access.  
- Our director, **who joined the company in 2019**, approved the changes.

## Reading – The Spaces That Shape Modern Work

Modern work is no longer defined only by physical offices. Instead, it is shaped by digital systems that connect people across countries and institutions.

Co-working spaces, which have become popular in large cities, offer shared environments for professionals who do not work for one company. These spaces attract freelancers and remote employees who need structure but value independence.

Technology platforms that manage communication and scheduling have replaced many traditional systems. Teams that operate across time zones depend on tools which allow information to be accessed instantly.

However, this transformation has also created new challenges. Workers who rarely meet colleagues in person often report weaker social bonds. Offices where informal interaction once happened naturally are being replaced by systems that require deliberate effort to build community.

The modern workplace is therefore not just a location, but a network of environments which influence how people collaborate, communicate and feel.

2. Who usually uses co-working spaces?
3. What role do digital platforms play?
4. What problem do remote workers often experience?
5. What does the text suggest about modern work?
