## Warm-up – Why Things Happen

## Grammar Focus – Reasons and Results

We use different structures to connect ideas logically.

### ➤ Giving reasons
- because / since / as + clause  
- because of / due to + noun

Examples:  
- She stayed at home **because she was ill**.  
- The event was cancelled **due to bad weather**.

### ➤ Showing results
- so + clause  
- therefore / as a result (more formal)

Examples:  
- He missed the deadline, **so** the project was delayed.  
- The system failed. **As a result**, services were interrupted.

## Reading – When One Change Affects Everything

Modern systems are highly connected. Because departments depend on each other, a small change in one area often produces unexpected results elsewhere.

Last year, a company decided to centralise customer support. The decision was made because management wanted to reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the local offices were closed, and response times increased. As a result, customers felt disconnected and complaints rose.

Since many experienced employees left the company, training new staff became difficult. Because of this lack of experience, mistakes were made more frequently. Therefore, instead of solving problems, the new system created additional ones.

The situation improved only after the company invested in training and reopened regional support centres. As a result of these changes, service quality slowly recovered.
