## Warm-up – Thinking Ahead

Discuss:

1. Do people always think about consequences before acting?
2. What happens when solutions are rushed?
3. Is it better to try a solution quickly or plan carefully?
4. Can a good solution have negative effects?

## Grammar Focus – Talking About Consequences

When we talk about solutions, we often explain **results**.

### ➤ First conditional (real situations)

- If we change the schedule, productivity will improve.
- If people don’t communicate, problems will continue.

### ➤ Result expressions

- this will lead to…  
- this could result in…  
- as a result…  
- this might help to…

Examples:  
- If we invest in training, this will lead to better performance.  
- Reducing stress could result in higher motivation.

5. If we don’t act now, __________.

## Reading – When Solutions Create New Problems

Finding a solution is often seen as the final step, but in reality it is only the beginning. Every solution creates change, and change always brings consequences.

For example, allowing employees to work remotely may increase flexibility and satisfaction. At the same time, it could reduce teamwork or informal communication. Similarly, cutting costs might help a company survive financially, but it may lead to lower morale or higher stress.

Successful decision-makers therefore think in stages. They ask not only *“Will this solve the problem?”* but also *“What will happen next?”* This approach helps them prepare for side effects and adjust their plans if necessary.

Understanding consequences does not mean avoiding action. It means choosing solutions responsibly, with awareness of their possible impact on people and systems.

## Controlled Speaking – Predicting Outcomes

Choose one solution and predict the consequences.

- flexible working hours  
- shorter deadlines  
- more meetings  
- fewer rules  

Use at least **two conditional sentences**.

Then switch roles.
