## Reading – When Problems Are Not Named

Many problems grow not because they are big, but because they are unclear. In workplaces and communities, people often feel dissatisfied, stressed or confused, yet they struggle to explain exactly what is wrong.

A team may say that “communication is bad,” but this description is often too general. Does it mean that information arrives too late? That decisions are not shared? Or that people are afraid to speak openly? Without naming the real issue, frustration increases and responsibility becomes blurred.

Unclear problems also lead to ineffective solutions. Organisations may introduce new systems, change schedules or hire new staff, but the situation does not improve. This happens because the real cause was never identified.

Clear language is therefore essential. When people learn to describe problems precisely, they create the first step toward change. Understanding the situation allows teams and individuals to move from emotion to action.
