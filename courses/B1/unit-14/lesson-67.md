## Warm-up – Looking for Solutions

Discuss:

1. When you have a problem, do you usually complain or look for solutions?
2. Who do you ask for advice?
3. Is it easy for you to suggest ideas in a group?
4. What makes a solution realistic?

---

## Grammar Focus – Making Suggestions

When people talk about solutions, they often use **soft, open structures**.

### ➤ Giving suggestions

- should / shouldn’t  
- could  
- why don’t we…  
- what if we…  
- maybe we could…  
- one possible solution is…

Examples:  
- We should talk about the problem openly.  
- Maybe we could change the schedule.  
- Why don’t we ask for support?  
- One possible solution is flexible working hours.

---

## Controlled Practice – Complete the Suggestions

Complete the sentences.

1. One possible solution is __________.  
2. Maybe we could __________.  
3. We should __________ to improve the situation.  
4. What if we __________?  
5. Why don’t we __________ together?

## Reading – From Problems to Solutions

When a problem is clearly described, the next step is to search for solutions. However, effective solutions are rarely immediate. They often begin as small ideas that grow through discussion.

In professional environments, successful teams focus on possibilities rather than blame. Instead of asking who caused the problem, they ask what can be done. This shift in thinking encourages creativity and shared responsibility.

Good solutions are usually realistic and flexible. They consider the people involved, the available resources and possible consequences. A solution that works in theory may fail in practice if it ignores human behaviour.

For this reason, proposing solutions is not only about ideas, but also about communication. People must listen, adapt suggestions and sometimes combine several approaches to reach an effective outcome.

## Grammar Practice – Choose the Best Option

1. One possible solution __________ to reorganise the schedule.  
   (is / are)

2. Why don’t we __________ a meeting to discuss this issue?  
   (organising / organise)

3. We could __________ external support if the problem continues.  
   (ask for / asking)

4. What if we __________ the process instead of replacing it?  
   (improve / improved)

5. Maybe we __________ try a different approach.  
   (but / should)

## Controlled Speaking – Suggesting Solutions

Choose a problem:

- poor communication at work  
- stress and overload  
- lack of motivation  
- time management issues  

Make at least **three different suggestions** using:

- should  
- could  
- what if…  
- one possible solution is…

## Speaking Task – Solution Discussion

Person A: describe a problem.  
Person B: suggest two solutions.  
Person A: react and choose the better option.

Then change roles.

**“A common problem and some possible solutions.”**

Include:

- a clear description of the problem  
- at least three suggestions
