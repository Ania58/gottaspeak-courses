## Warm-up – When Solutions Don’t Work

Think and answer:

1. Have you ever heard a solution that sounded good but wouldn’t work for you?
2. Is it easy for you to say that you disagree with an idea?
3. What do you usually do if a solution is partly good, but not perfect?
4. Is compromise always a good thing?

## Functional Language – Reacting to Solutions

When people discuss solutions, they rarely say just *yes* or *no*.

### ➤ Accepting a solution

- That sounds reasonable.  
- I think that could work.  
- I’m happy with that solution.

### ➤ Rejecting politely

- I’m not sure that would work.  
- I see the idea, but I don’t think it’s realistic.  
- I don’t think this solves the real problem.

### ➤ Modifying a solution

- Maybe we could adjust it slightly.  
- What if we tried a different approach?  
- I like the idea, but I’d change one thing.

Examples:  
- I like the idea, but I’d change the timeline.  
- I’m not sure that would work because of the costs.

## Controlled Practice – Choose the Best Reaction

1. “Let’s solve the problem by adding more meetings.”  
   a) That sounds reasonable.  
   b) I’m not sure that would work. Meetings already take too much time.

2. “We could reduce stress by shortening deadlines.”  
   a) I see the idea, but that could increase pressure.  
   b) Yes shorten.

3. “What if we asked employees to work overtime for a month?”  
   a) That’s fine.  
   b) I don’t think this solves the real problem.

4. “Let’s cancel the project completely.”  
   a) I’m happy with that solution.  
   b) I like the idea, but I’d change one thing: maybe pause it instead.

5. “We could improve communication by using one shared platform.”  
   a) I think that could work.  
   b) No.

## Reading – A Decision That Almost Failed

When Laura joined a small marketing company, she quickly noticed a problem: projects were always late, and people blamed each other. Management decided the solution was simple — more control.

They introduced daily progress reports and extra meetings. At first, this seemed organised. But within weeks, employees felt watched rather than supported. Stress increased, motivation dropped, and deadlines were still missed.

Laura didn’t reject the idea completely. Instead, she suggested a change. The team kept one short weekly meeting, but removed the daily reports. They also introduced clear task ownership, so everyone knew their role.

The solution worked — not because it was perfect, but because it was adapted. The real problem wasn’t lack of control, but unclear responsibility.

2. What solution did management choose first?  
3. Why did this solution fail?  
4. What change did Laura suggest?  
5. What was the real problem in the end?
