## Grammar Focus: Speculation and Logical Deduction

We use modal verbs to talk about **possibility, probability and certainty** when we don’t know all the facts.

### ✔ **might / may / could** – possible, but not certain  
- He **might** be under a lot of pressure.  
- They **may** not know the full story.  
- Something **could** have gone wrong.

### ✔ **must** – logical conclusion (very likely)  
- She looks exhausted. She **must** be working too much.  

### ✔ **can’t** – logical impossibility  
- He knows all the details. He **can’t** be unaware of the problem.

👉 These forms are common in:
- investigations  
- news reports  
- problem analysis  
- everyday reasoning

## Reading: The Unanswered Questions

When a situation changes suddenly, people naturally try to explain it. They look for patterns, connect details and search for meaning. This process often begins with speculation. Small signs become evidence. Impressions turn into assumptions.

Consider a company where several employees resign within a short period. Management may offer official explanations, but workers start drawing their own conclusions. The problem might be financial, or it could involve leadership conflicts. It must be serious if experienced staff are leaving. At the same time, it can’t simply be coincidence.

However, speculation can easily become distortion. When facts are missing, the mind fills the gaps. Rumours grow, suspicions spread and emotional reactions replace careful reasoning. What may have started as curiosity can turn into fear or blame.

Responsible judgement requires distance. Instead of immediate conclusions, it involves recognising uncertainty. Understanding what might be happening, what must be happening and what cannot be happening allows people to respond with clarity rather than impulse.
