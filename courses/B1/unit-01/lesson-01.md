## Grammar Focus: Present Perfect vs Past Simple (7 min)

We use the **present perfect** to talk about life experiences and changes when the exact time is **not important** or **not mentioned**.

> I have changed jobs several times.  
> She has lived in three different countries.

We use the **past simple** when we talk about **finished actions** at a **specific time in the past**.

> I changed jobs last year.  
> She lived in Spain for five years.

Very often, both tenses appear together:
- the present perfect introduces the experience
- the past simple gives details

> I have worked in different companies, but I left my last job in 2022.

Common time expressions:
- **Present perfect:** ever, never, already, yet, recently, so far
- **Past simple:** yesterday, last year, in 2019, when I was a child

## Reading: A Change That Made a Difference (8 min)

When Marta finished university, she had no clear plans. She took a job in an office and stayed there for almost five years. During that time, she learned a lot, but she often felt stuck and unmotivated.

Two years ago, she has decided to make a change. She left her job, moved to a smaller city, and started working remotely. Since then, her daily life has completely changed. She has gained more confidence, improved her work-life balance, and met people who share her interests.

Looking back, Marta says it was a difficult decision, but one she does not regret. The experience has taught her that sometimes taking a risk is necessary in order to grow.
