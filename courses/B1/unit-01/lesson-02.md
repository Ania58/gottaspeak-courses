## Reading: When People Drift Apart (8 min)

Friendships often change as people grow older. Many adults notice that they no longer spend time with friends they were once very close to. This does not always happen because of conflict. In many cases, people simply drift apart.

Work, family responsibilities, and different priorities can make it difficult to keep in touch. Sometimes, one person tries to open up, while the other avoids difficult conversations. Small misunderstandings are not always brought up, and over time, distance grows.

However, drifting apart does not always mean the end of a relationship. Some people reconnect later in life and realise that mutual respect and trust are still there. What matters most is how willing people are to communicate honestly.
