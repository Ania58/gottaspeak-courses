## Language Focus: Expressing Opinions Clearly (7 min)

When adults communicate, it is important to:
- explain **why** we think something,
- react to other people’s opinions,
- describe possible consequences of our choices.

Useful language:
- **In my opinion / From my point of view**
- **I agree / I don’t completely agree**
- **If this continues, it will…** (first conditional)
- **bring up an issue**
- **get on with someone**
- **be fed up with a situation**

Being clear does not mean being rude. Calm explanations help people stay on the same wavelength.

## Reading: Speaking Up at the Right Time (8 min)

In many social and professional situations, people hesitate to express their opinions. They may worry about conflict or about damaging relationships. As a result, important issues are often not brought up.

However, if people stay silent for too long, frustration can build. Being fed up with a situation does not solve anything. When concerns are shared respectfully, others are more likely to listen and respond positively.

Expressing opinions clearly also helps people understand the possible consequences of their choices. If communication improves, relationships usually become stronger and more balanced.
