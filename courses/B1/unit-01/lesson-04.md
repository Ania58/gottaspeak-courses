## Grammar Focus: First Conditional (7 min)

We use the **first conditional** to talk about **real and possible situations in the future** and their **results**.

**Structure:**
- **If / When + present simple**, **will + base verb**

> If I take this job, I will have less free time.  
> If we don’t talk about the problem, it will get worse.

We also use:
- **unless** (= if not)  
  > Unless you tell the truth, people won’t trust you.
- **as long as / provided (that)**  
  > I’ll support you as long as you’re honest.
- **otherwise** (to show a negative result)  
  > We need to decide now, otherwise we’ll miss the opportunity.

The order of the clauses can change:
> I’ll stay here if everything goes well.

## Reading: The Cost of Avoiding Decisions (8 min)

Many adults delay important decisions because they are afraid of making mistakes. Avoiding a choice can feel safer than taking a risk, especially when the consequences are unclear.

However, if people do not face problems directly, the situation often becomes more complicated. Small issues can grow into serious conflicts. If decisions are postponed for too long, opportunities may disappear.

People who learn to take responsibility for their choices usually feel more confident over time. Even when the result is not perfect, making a decision allows them to move forward instead of feeling stuck.
