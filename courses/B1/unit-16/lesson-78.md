## Reading – Case Study: Choosing an Apartment

Leo recently moved to a new city and had to choose between three apartments. None of them was perfect, so he had to think carefully about what was good enough and what was simply too much.

The first apartment was modern and close to the city centre. However, it was **far too expensive**, and Leo would **run out of** money every month. Even though it looked amazing, he knew it wasn’t realistic. It just wasn’t **worth it**.

The second place was cheap enough, but it was **too far** from work. The commute would take almost two hours a day. Leo didn’t want to **give up** all his free time just to save money.

The third apartment wasn’t perfect either, but it seemed balanced. It was big enough, close enough to work, and the rent was reasonable. He would still need to **cut back on** some spending, but he wouldn’t have to **take on** extra shifts or a second job.

In the end, Leo chose the third option. It wasn’t the best apartment in the city, but it **worked out** well. Sometimes the perfect choice doesn’t exist – you just need something good enough.
