## Warm-up – Asking for Advice

Discuss:

1. Who do you usually ask for advice?
2. Do you prefer giving advice or receiving it?

We prefer **soft, polite suggestions**.

## Reading – Advice Column: “Which Option Should I Choose?”

This week, three readers wrote to our advice column asking for help with important decisions.

---

### Case 1 – New Job

“I have two job offers. One pays more, but the hours are long. The other pays less but is flexible.”

**Advice:**  
You should **weigh up** the long-term benefits, not just the salary. If I were you, I’d **go for** the job that gives you more balance. Extra money isn’t always **worth it** if you’re exhausted all the time.

---

### Case 2 – Online Course

“I want to take a course, but it’s expensive.”

**Advice:**  
You might want to **look into** cheaper alternatives first. Don’t **rush into** a decision. Maybe **hold off** for a month and save more money. You don’t want to **end up** stressed about costs later.

---

### Case 3 – Moving to a New City

“I’m thinking about moving for work, but I’m nervous.”

**Advice:**  
If I were you, I’d **figure out** the pros and cons first. Talk to people who live there. It’s often better to **play it safe** and plan carefully rather than make a quick decision you regret.
