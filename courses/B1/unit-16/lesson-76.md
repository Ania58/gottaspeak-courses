## Reading – Choosing Between Two Job Offers

Last month Marta received two job offers, and she had to **weigh up her options** carefully.

The first company offered a higher salary. It was **much better paid** and slightly closer to her home. However, the job description sounded stressful and the hours were longer. She would probably finish work late most days.

The second offer wasn’t **as well paid as** the first one, but it was **far more flexible**. She could work remotely three days a week, and the team culture seemed friendlier. The manager even said she could choose her own schedule.

At first, Marta was ready to **go for** the higher salary. More money always sounded attractive. But after thinking about the **pros and cons**, she realised the first job might burn her out quickly.

She finally **ruled out** the stressful option and **turned down** the offer. Instead, she accepted the second job. It paid less, but it gave her more time and energy.

Six months later, she knows she made the right decision. The flexible schedule has really **paid off**, and she feels happier and more productive.
