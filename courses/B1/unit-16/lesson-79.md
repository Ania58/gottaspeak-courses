## Reading – Team Meeting: Choosing a Training Course  

Three colleagues are trying to decide which professional training course to take.

**Lena:** So, we have three options: online, weekend intensive, or evening classes. What do you think?

**Mark:** I’d rather do the online one. It’s more flexible.

**Sara:** I prefer face-to-face classes. I learn better that way.

**Lena:** Yeah, same here. I’d prefer something interactive.

**Mark:** True, but evening classes might be too tiring after work.

**Sara:** Good point. Maybe we should **go with** the weekend course?

**Lena:** Possibly. But it’s more expensive. I don’t want to **settle for** something cheap, though. This is important.

**Mark:** Let’s **sleep on it** and decide tomorrow.
