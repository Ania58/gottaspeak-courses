1. What are some rude things people do online?

-------
## Grammar Input (6 min)
**Indirect Questions – polite communication**  
- Direct: “Where is my file?” → Indirect: Could you tell me where my file is?  
- Direct: “Why are you late?” → Indirect: Do you know why you’re late?  
- Direct: “When does the meeting start?” → Indirect: Can you tell me when the meeting starts?  

**Key rule:**  
In indirect questions, the word order is **subject + verb** (no question order).

Common mistakes:  
❌ Can you tell me where is the file  
✅ Can you tell me where the file is  

❌ I don’t know where is she  
✅ I don’t know where she is

## Skills – Reading (5 min)
**Reading: Being Polite Online**

Online communication is fast, but it can easily sound rude if people are not careful. When writing emails or messages, using polite language and indirect questions helps avoid misunderstandings. For example, instead of asking *“Why didn’t you reply?”*, it is better to ask *“Could you tell me when you have time to reply?”*  

Tone is also important. Short messages without emojis or polite words can sound angry or cold. Showing respect, saying *please* and *thank you*, and replying calmly help create better online relationships. Good digital etiquette makes communication clearer and more friendly.

**Answer:**  
1. Why can online messages sound rude easily?  
2. What examples of polite behaviour are mentioned?  
3. Which indirect question from the text sounds most polite to you?
