## Skills – Reading (5 min)
**Reading: Everyday Technology Problems**

Many people depend on technology every day, but problems often appear at the worst moment. You might try to **log in** to an app and realise you forgot your password. During online meetings, weak internet **connections** can make the screen freeze or the sound disappear.  

Phone calls can also be frustrating. Sometimes the **signal** is poor, so people need to **speak up** or repeat themselves. Other times, the battery dies because the phone wasn’t **charged**, and the call suddenly ends.  

To avoid these problems, it’s important to check your **network**, keep your **charger** nearby, and make sure your devices are turned off properly when you finish using them.

**Answer:**  
1. What technology problems are mentioned in the text?  
2. Which phrasal verbs describe the actions people take?  
3. What advice does the text give to avoid problems?
