## Skills – Reading (5 min)
**Reading: Communication in the Digital Age**

Modern communication is fast and easy, but it can also be confusing. Many people meet online and need to **break the ice** before they feel comfortable talking. Social media helps friends **keep in touch**, even when they live far away.  

Sometimes information spreads by **word of mouth**, especially when people share news with friends before checking the facts. This can cause rumours, so it’s important to look at the **big picture** and think carefully before believing everything you hear.  

Good communication is not only about speaking. Silence, listening, and understanding connections between people are just as important.
