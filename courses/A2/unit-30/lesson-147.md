## Grammar Input (6 min)
**Zero Conditional – facts (if + present, present)**  
- If water reaches 100°C, it boils.  
- If it rains, plants grow.  

👉 Used for things that are **always true**.

**First Conditional – future results (if + present, will + base verb)**  
- If we plant more trees, the air will be cleaner.  
- If people waste water, there will be problems.  

Common mistakes:  
❌ If I will recycle → ✅ If I recycle  
❌ It will rains → ✅ It will rain  

👉 Used for **real and possible future situations**.

### Reading: *If We Change Our Actions, the Planet Can Recover*

The environment reacts directly to human actions. If people pollute the air, breathing becomes more difficult. If waste ends up in rivers and oceans, animals suffer and ecosystems are damaged. These are clear examples of cause and effect.

However, the future is not fixed. If people recycle more and reduce energy use, pollution will decrease. If governments invest in renewable energy, cities will become cleaner and healthier places to live. Scientists agree that small actions, when repeated every day, can create real change.

The planet does not need perfection, but it does need responsibility. If people understand the consequences of their actions, they will make better choices for the future.

**Questions:**  
1. What happens if people pollute the air and water?  
2. What future results are mentioned if people change their behaviour?  
3. Which examples describe general facts?  
4. Which examples describe possible future results?
