## Skills – Reading (5 min)
### Reading: *Small Actions, Big Environmental Impact*

Many environmental problems are caused by everyday habits. When people throw away plastic bottles and bags, they often end up in rivers or oceans. If rubbish is not cleaned up, it harms animals and pollutes water.

Energy use is another serious issue. Cars and factories give off gases that damage the air and contribute to climate change. If people cut down on electricity use and turn off devices when they are not needed, pollution can be reduced.

Communities around the world are taking action. Volunteers clean up parks and beaches, and families try not to run out of resources by using less and reusing more. Small changes may seem unimportant, but together they can make a real difference.
