## Skills – Reading (5 min)
### Reading: *Our Planet and Its Future*

The Earth is full of different natural places such as mountains, forests, rivers and oceans. Each place has its own climate and animals. Forests are very important because they produce oxygen and help keep the air clean. Oceans cover most of the planet and are home to millions of sea animals.

However, pollution is becoming a serious problem. Plastic waste is found in rivers and oceans, and dirty air affects both people and nature. Climate change also causes extreme weather, such as very hot summers or long periods without rain.

Many people believe that protecting nature is everyone’s responsibility. Small actions, like using less plastic and saving water, can help protect the planet for future generations.

**Questions:**  
1. What natural places are mentioned in the text?  
2. Why are forests important?  
3. What environmental problems are described?  
4. What small actions can help protect nature?
