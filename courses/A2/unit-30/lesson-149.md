## Skills – Reading (5 min)
### Reading: *Small Actions and Big Change*

Many people believe that protecting the planet is too big a problem for one person. Recycling one bottle or planting one tree can feel like a drop in the ocean. However, when millions of people do small actions every day, real change becomes possible.

Some people have a green thumb and grow their own food. This helps reduce pollution and improves their health. Others help by cleaning parks or talking openly about environmental problems to clear the air in their communities.

Even when people feel under the weather or discouraged, they can still make a difference. Simple actions, repeated often, slowly improve the situation and show that every effort matters.

**Questions:**  
1. Why do small actions sometimes feel useless?  
2. How do people with a green thumb help the environment?  
3. What does “clear the air” mean in the text?  
4. Which idioms from the lesson appear in the reading?
