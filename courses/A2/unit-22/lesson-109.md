## Skills – Reading (5 min)
**Reading: “The Future Lab”**

A new technology lab has opened in London, and many people say it is *the cutting edge* of modern innovation. The lab tests robots that can learn new tasks by watching humans. Some engineers say these robots are *light years ahead* of anything we use today.

One project in the lab is a cooking robot. At first, people thought it would be very difficult to build, but the team said, “Relax, *it’s not rocket science*!” After several tests, a short video of the robot making pasta *went viral* online.

However, not everyone is excited. Some companies are still using very old devices and are *behind the times*. The lab hopes these inventions will help more people update their technology in the future.

**Answer:**  
1. What technologies does the lab develop?  
2. Which idioms can describe these innovations?  
3. Why did the video become popular?  
4. Why are some companies “behind the times”?  
5. Would you like to visit this lab? Why/why not?
