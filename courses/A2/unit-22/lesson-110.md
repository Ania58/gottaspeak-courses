## Skills – Reading (6 min)
**Text: “AI at Work: What Will Change?”**

In many companies, AI is already helping workers with simple tasks. Some offices use virtual assistants to answer questions or organise schedules. Factories are changing too — machines can do dangerous or boring jobs through automation.  

However, not every job will disappear. Many experts say that creative jobs, teaching, and healthcare roles are safer because they need human emotions and communication. At the same time, new jobs will appear. People will need skills such as coding, problem-solving, and data analysis.  

Most scientists agree on one thing: AI will not replace everyone, but it **will** change how we work. If people learn new skills, they will have more opportunities in the future.

**Answer:**  
1. What changes does AI bring to different workplaces?  
2. Which jobs seem safe according to the text?  
3. What skills might be important in the future?
