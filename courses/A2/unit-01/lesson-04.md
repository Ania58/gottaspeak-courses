## Warm-up (5 min)

## Grammar Focus (7 min)
### Past Simple: regular & irregular verbs
- I watched a film yesterday.  
- I went shopping with my friend.  

**Spelling (regular verbs):**  
- play → played | watch → watched | study → studied (y → ied)  
**Irregular verbs (A2 set):** go → went | have → had | eat → ate | buy → bought | do → did | see → saw

**Common mistakes to avoid**  
❌ *Yesterday I go to the cinema.* → ✅ *Yesterday I went to the cinema.*  
❌ *I not went to school.* → ✅ *I didn’t go to school.*  
❌ *Did you went?* → ✅ *Did you go?*
