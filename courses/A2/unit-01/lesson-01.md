## Warm-up (5 min)
- What do you usually do in the morning before work or school?  
- What are you doing right now?  
- How is your morning today different from yesterday?  

---

## Grammar Focus (7 min)
### Present Simple vs Present Continuous

| Use | Example |
|------|----------|
| Daily habits or routines | I usually have breakfast at 7. |
| Actions happening now | I’m having breakfast right now. |
| Temporary situations | She’s staying with her parents this week. |
| General truths | Water boils at 100°C. |

**Signal words:**  
- *always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never* → with **Present Simple**  
- *now, right now, today, at the moment* → with **Present Continuous**

**Common mistakes:**  
❌ I’m going always to work by bus. → ✅ I always go to work by bus.  
❌ He go to school every day. → ✅ He goes to school every day.  
❌ They watches TV now. → ✅ They are watching TV now.
