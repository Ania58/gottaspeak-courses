**Reading: “A Home That Finally Feels Like Mine”**

When I first moved into my current flat, it didn’t feel like home at all. The rooms were empty, the walls were plain, and the neighbour I shared the staircase with barely said hello. For the first few weeks, I only came back to sleep. I didn’t feel at home, and I wasn’t sure I had made the right decision.

But little by little, things changed. I bought a soft rug for the living room, put up some pictures on the wall, and added a small lamp that made the evenings warm and calm. One Saturday, my neighbour knocked on the door to borrow a key for the shared storage room, and we ended up talking for almost an hour. Since then, we get on really well — sometimes we have coffee together in the hallway.

The moment that really *hit home* for me came one rainy afternoon. I was returning from a stressful day at work, and as soon as I opened the door, I felt something I hadn’t felt for a long time: peace. The flat wasn’t perfect — the roof still needed a repair, and the bills always arrived at the worst moment — but it felt safe, quiet, and mine.

Now, whenever I return from a trip, I walk in, put down my bag, and think: *Home sweet home.*
