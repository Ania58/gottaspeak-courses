## Skills – Reading (6 min)
**Reading: “A Place That Feels Like Home”**

I live in a district **where** people know each other and say hello on the street. It’s a quiet residential area **that** many families choose because there are parks, schools, and small cafés.  
Near my flat, there is a square **where** local markets take place every weekend. I love walking there on Saturday mornings because there are stalls **that** sell fruit, handmade bread, and flowers.  

If you walk ten minutes from my street, you reach the river, **where** people run, cycle, or sit on the benches. The riverside is one of the places **that** make this district special.  

Downtown, **where** I work, is very different. It’s busy, loud, and full of tall buildings. There are shops and offices **that** stay open until late. I like the energy, but it’s the quiet neighbourhood **where** I live that feels like home.

**Answer:**  
1. What places are mentioned in the text?  
2. Which relative clauses can you find?  
3. What makes the district special?  
4. How is downtown different from the speaker’s neighbourhood?  
5. Which place is more similar to yours: the quiet district or the busy downtown?
