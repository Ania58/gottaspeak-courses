## Skills – Reading (6 min)
**Text: “Homes Around the World”**

In Japan, many people live in small but modern apartments. There is usually one main room, a small kitchen, and a bathroom. There isn’t much space, but there are clever solutions — folding beds and tables, for example.  

In Canada, there are large houses with big gardens. There is often a garage for two cars and a wooden deck behind the house. In winter, there is a lot of snow, so there are fireplaces in many homes.  

In Morocco, there are beautiful traditional houses called riads. There is a central courtyard with a fountain, and there are colourful tiles on the walls. Families spend time together there in the evening.  

No matter where you live, there is always something that makes a home special — it can be the people, the view, or the feeling of comfort.
