**“My Apartment”**

Hi! Today I want to tell you about the apartment I moved into last year.  
When you enter, there is a small hallway with a mirror on the wall and a narrow shoe cabinet under it. On the right, there is a door to the bathroom, and on the left there is a long corridor leading to the main rooms.

The living room is my favourite space. There is a large sofa in front of the window, and a coffee table between the sofa and the TV stand. The TV is opposite the window, which means I sometimes have problems with sunlight, but I love how bright the room is. There is also a bookshelf next to the sofa, and two plants behind it. On the wall, above the bookshelf, there is a big framed map of the world.

The kitchen is next to the living room, separated only by a sliding glass door. There are two tall stools in front of the counter, and most evenings I sit there while cooking. Above the counter there are three small lights, and under the counter there is a dishwasher. The fridge is at the end of the room, between the oven and the balcony door.

My bedroom is simple. The bed is in the middle of the room, with two small lamps on the tables beside it. There is a wardrobe opposite the bed, and a soft rug on the floor in front of it. Under the bed, I keep boxes with old photos and letters.

It’s not a huge apartment, but everything has its place, and the layout makes it comfortable to live in.

**Answer:**  
1. What is in the hallway?  
2. Why does the speaker sometimes have problems with sunlight?  
3. What is on the wall above the bookshelf?  
4. Where are the stools in the kitchen?  
5. What items are kept under the bed?  
6. Why is the apartment comfortable for the speaker?
