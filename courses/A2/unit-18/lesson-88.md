### **Text: “My Health Experiences This Year”**

This year has been quite surprising for me. I have visited the doctor three times already, which is more than in the last five years. First, I have had a bad cold twice, and I have taken medicine for it both times. I have also had a small injury: I’ve cut my finger while cooking, so I’ve been more careful in the kitchen since then.

In the past few months, I have tried to live more healthily. I’ve started eating more vegetables, and I’ve already reduced sugar in my diet. I haven’t drunk any cola this month, and I haven’t eaten fast food since January. I’ve also done more exercise — I’ve walked to work every day and I’ve joined a weekend fitness class.

Because of these changes, I’ve felt better and I haven’t had any serious health problems recently. I’ve learned that small habits can make a big difference, and I’ve decided to continue with this routine. I haven’t reached all my goals yet, but I’ve definitely made progress.

**Answer:**  
1. What health problems has the person had this year?  
2. What healthy habits has the person started?  
3. Which Present Perfect sentences can you find?  
4. Which of these habits have you already tried?
