**“Time in Everyday Life”**  

For most people, time moves very fast. We wake up, go to work, and before we know it, the day is over — time flies!  
During the week, many people don’t have time for fun. They work, cook, and study. But at the weekend, things are different. That’s when they relax and have a whale of a time with their friends.  
Sometimes, when we wait for someone or something, we look at our phones or read a book to kill time. And of course, everyone needs a break — after a long day, we just call it a day and rest.  
Life is busy, but it’s important to stop once in a blue moon and enjoy it.
