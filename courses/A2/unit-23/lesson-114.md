### Text: *“Small Actions, Big Change”*

Many people don’t realize how simple habits can help the planet.  
Some families **cut down on** plastic by using reusable bags. Others **clean up** local parks every month. At home, people **switch off** lights when they leave a room and try not to **throw away** food.  

Sometimes a family **runs out of** energy or water faster than they expect. This helps them understand how important it is to save resources.  
When more people make small changes every day, the world slowly becomes cleaner.
