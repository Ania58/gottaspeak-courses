## Skills – Reading (5 min)
### **Reading: “When Weather Changes, People Must Adapt”**

In many countries, climate change is becoming a serious problem.  
Temperatures are rising, **so** summers are longer and hotter.  
There is less rain in some areas, **as a result**, farmers lose crops during long droughts.  
In other places, heavy rain comes suddenly, **therefore** cities experience floods.  

Because the weather is changing, people must change their habits too.  
Some cities plant more trees because they help cool the air.  
People also save water during dry seasons, **so** there is enough for everyone.  

Scientists warn that if pollution continues, storms will become stronger.  
**As a result**, many families may need to move to safer areas.  
However, if people recycle more and use less energy, the planet will recover slowly.
