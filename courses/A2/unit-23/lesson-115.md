**Text: “Small Actions, Big Change”**

Many people think their actions are *just a drop in the ocean*, but small steps can create real change.  
For example, in one city, a group of students decided to clean a local beach every weekend. At first, it looked like **the tip of the iceberg**, because there was so much rubbish. But after a few months, the beach became cleaner, and more people joined.

One woman with a **green thumb** started a community garden where neighbours grow vegetables together. This garden has *made a difference* to local families, who now have fresh food and a greener neighbourhood.

Even if the world’s environmental problems are huge, these stories show that small actions can inspire *big change*.

**Answer:**  
1. What problems or actions are described?  
2. Which idioms match the situations?  
3. Which example inspires you the most?
