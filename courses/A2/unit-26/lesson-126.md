### Reading: *Finding Work–Life Balance*

Many people today feel stressed because they work too much and rest too little. Long hours, tight deadlines and constant messages make it hard to relax. Over time, this stress can affect both health and relationships.

Work–life balance means finding time not only for work, but also for rest, hobbies and family. Some people try to set clear routines, for example stopping work at the same time every day. Others avoid checking emails in the evening so they can enjoy their free time.

Experts say that small changes can help a lot. Taking short breaks, doing something active, or spending time on a hobby can reduce stress. When people rest well, they often work better too.
