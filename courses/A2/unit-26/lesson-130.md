**Text: Small Habits, Big Impact**

Many people think that mental health depends only on big life changes, but daily routines are often more important. Sleeping well, eating regular meals and moving your body help the brain work better.

People who usually go to bed at the same time feel calmer during the day. Exercise gives energy, even when you feel tired at first. Meditation or quiet time helps reduce stress, especially after work.

Problems appear when routines disappear. If someone rarely rests or often skips sleep, their mood and concentration suffer. Balance doesn’t mean perfection – it means paying attention to your habits and adjusting them when necessary.

**Questions:**  
1. Which daily habits support mental health?  
2. What happens when routines disappear?  
3. Which habit would you like to improve first?
