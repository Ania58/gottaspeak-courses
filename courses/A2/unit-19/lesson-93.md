### **Text: “A Busy Morning in the Office”**

This morning has been very busy at my office. I’ve already checked my email, and I’ve replied to five important messages. Our team has also had a short meeting, and we’ve discussed a new project for next month. I haven’t finished the project plan yet, but I’ve started writing the first part.

My colleague Anna has prepared a presentation for our client, and she has already sent the final slides to the manager. Tom hasn’t come to the office yet because he is working from home today, but he has uploaded all the files we need.

We’ve completed many small tasks this morning, but we still haven’t met today’s deadline. There is still a lot to do, but we’ve made good progress.

**Answer:**  
1. What tasks have been completed already?  
2. Which tasks haven’t been finished yet?  
3. Which worker has done the most today? Why?
