### **Text: “A Job with Pressure and Passion”**

Many people dream about a job that is exciting and meaningful, but real work often includes stress and deadlines.  
Emily works as a junior journalist for a local newspaper. For her, it is not a **dream job** yet, but she hopes it will become one in the future. She often has to **work against the clock**, especially when there is breaking news and the team must publish an article quickly.  

Her boss, Mr. Carter, is the **big cheese** in the office — everyone listens to him, and he decides what stories are important. Emily likes him, but she knows she must always **pull her weight**, because the team depends on each person.  

Before this job, Emily worked in a café. She loved her colleagues, but it was a **dead-end job** with no chance to grow. Now she feels she is finally building real **experience**, even if the work is sometimes difficult.  

Last month, one colleague **got the sack** for never meeting deadlines. It was a shock, but it reminded Emily that journalism is a serious job. Despite the pressure, she is happy — every day brings a new story, and she feels she is learning something important.

**Answer:**  
1. What job does Emily have now?  
2. Which idioms describe her situation?  
3. Why was her previous job a dead-end job?  
4. Would you like a job with pressure but passion?
