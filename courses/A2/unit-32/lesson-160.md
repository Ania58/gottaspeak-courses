**Reading: “Small Steps, Big Ambitions”**

Lena works in a small office and spends most of her day answering emails and organising meetings. She likes her job, but she knows it’s not what she wants to do forever. Her **goal** is to work in education and help people learn new skills.

If Lena had more confidence, she would apply for a better position right now. Instead, she has a **plan**. She is taking online courses in the evenings and saving money for the future. She knows that real **progress** takes time and **effort**.

Lena also believes in using every **opportunity** she gets. When her manager asked if anyone wanted extra training, she said yes immediately. She thinks **success** is not about luck, but about being ready when a chance appears. For Lena, the **future** is not something to wait for – it’s something to prepare for.

**Questions**
1. What is Lena’s long-term career goal?  
2. Why doesn’t she change her job immediately?
