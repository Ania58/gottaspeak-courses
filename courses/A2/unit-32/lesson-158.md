## Skills – Reading (5 min)
**Reading: “Changes at Work”**

Many people today experience changes at work. Some employees **take on** more responsibilities because their companies are growing. Others feel stressed and decide to **step down** from their positions to protect their health.

When work becomes busy, people try to **carry on** and manage their tasks better. They often need to **catch up on** emails and unfinished projects after holidays or busy weeks. Sometimes workers **look for** new jobs because they want better pay or more free time. However, not every offer is good, so they may **turn down** a job if it doesn’t fit their needs.

Learning how to manage work and make good decisions helps people feel more confident and satisfied in their careers.

**Questions:**
1. Why do some people take on more responsibilities?  
2. Why do others decide to step down from their jobs?  
3. Which phrasal verbs describe managing too much work?
