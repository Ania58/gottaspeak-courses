**Listening to Your Body**

In today’s fast-paced world, many people ignore their health until something goes wrong. They continue working even when they feel under the weather, believing that rest is a waste of time. However, doctors say that listening to your body is one of the most important habits for staying healthy.

People who are in good shape don’t only exercise regularly – they also know when to take it easy. They understand that rest is not laziness but a necessary part of a healthy life. Even short breaks during the day help people recharge their batteries and reduce stress.

Interestingly, many older people are as fit as a fiddle because they have simple routines: walking every day, eating regular meals and keeping a positive mood. Good health is not about doing everything perfectly, but about balance and care.
