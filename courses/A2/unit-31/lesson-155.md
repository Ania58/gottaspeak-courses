**Good Advice Is Not Always Easy to Follow**

Many people receive good advice every day, but that doesn’t mean they follow it. Doctors often advise their patients to rest more, exercise regularly and reduce stress. Friends suggest taking breaks or spending more time outdoors. Even when people know the advice is helpful, changing habits can be difficult.

One reason is that advice usually asks us to change something in our routine. Resting more might mean working less, and exercising might require giving up free time. However, people who listen to advice and apply it slowly often see real improvements in their health.

Experts say the best advice is simple and realistic. Instead of changing everything at once, it’s better to start with small steps. When advice feels achievable, people are more likely to follow it and benefit from it.

**Answer:**
1. Why do people often ignore good advice?  
2. What kind of advice works best according to the text?  
3. What advice from the text would you personally follow?
