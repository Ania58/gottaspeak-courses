**Text: “How People Feel During the Day”**

People feel different emotions during the day. In the morning, many people feel **tired** or **nervous**, especially when they have work or school. After lunch, people often feel more **relaxed**, because they have already finished part of their tasks.  

Good news, messages from friends, or small successes at work can make people feel **happy** or **excited**. But unexpected problems, like a missed bus or a difficult test, can make them feel **angry** or **worried**.  

In the evening, people usually want to rest. Some feel **calm**, while others feel **surprised** when something unexpected happens at home. Emotions change quickly, and everyone reacts in different ways.

**Answer:**  
1. What emotions are mentioned in the text?  
2. What makes people feel happy or excited?

4. How do you usually feel in the evening?
