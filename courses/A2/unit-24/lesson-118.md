## Skills – Reading (6 min)
**Reading Text: “How People React Differently”**  
People react in different ways when they face problems. Some people are much calmer and think before they act. They try to understand the situation and look for solutions. Others get nervous more quickly and feel emotions very strongly.

Friendly people often try to help everyone, while serious people prefer to focus quietly on their tasks. Clever students usually learn faster, but shy students may work harder because they want to improve. Brave people are far more confident in stressful moments, but patient people are often the most successful — they don’t give up easily.

Understanding these differences helps groups work better together. When people with different personalities cooperate, they can support each other and become a stronger team.

**Answer:**  
1. What different personality types are mentioned?  
2. Which personality type is the most similar to you?  
3. Why is having different personalities in a group useful?
