### Text: *Emotions at Work and at Home*

Everyone has emotional days. Sometimes we are **over the moon** because something great happens – a promotion, a good grade, or kind words from someone we care about. On other days, we may **feel blue** for no clear reason, and even small problems feel heavy.

Emotions can also cause trouble. If someone makes a mistake at work, they might be **in hot water** with their boss. In stressful situations like this, some people **lose their temper**, which often makes the problem worse. Shouting or blaming others rarely helps.

Learning to **keep your cool** is an important life skill. People who stay calm can think more clearly, explain their feelings better, and find solutions faster. Whether at work, at school, or at home, understanding emotions helps us build better relationships and deal with challenges in a healthier way.

**Answer:**
1. Which situations make people happy or sad?
2. What problems are caused by strong emotions?
3. Which idiom best describes how you usually react to stress?
