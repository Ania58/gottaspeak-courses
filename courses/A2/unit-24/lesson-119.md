**Text:** *Managing Emotions in Everyday Life*  

People react to emotions in different ways. When someone feels stressed or angry, it’s important to calm down before speaking. Some people prefer to open up and talk about their problems with friends, while others need time alone. Good relationships help people get along better and feel supported. When friends look after each other, it’s easier to deal with problems and cheer up after a bad day.
