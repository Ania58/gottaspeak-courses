## Warm-up (5 min)
- Think of the last time you were sick. What happened?
- How did you feel? What did you do?

## Grammar Focus (6 min) — **Should vs Must**
- **should** = advice/suggestion: *You should rest and drink water.*
- **must** = obligation/requirement (rules, labels, doctor’s orders): *You must take this medicine twice a day.*
- **mustn’t** = prohibition: *You mustn’t mix these medicines.*
- **shouldn’t** = negative advice: *You shouldn’t eat heavy food tonight.*

Common mistake:  
❌ *You should to take vitamins.* → ✅ *You should take vitamins.*
