### **Text: “How People Live Around the World”**

People around the world live in different ways, and these differences often come from culture and tradition.  
In Japan, people usually bow when they greet someone. This is a sign of respect. In Spain, people often greet each other with a kiss on the cheek, even when they meet for the first time. In India, many families eat meals together every day, and this tradition is very important for their family life.

Attitudes toward time also vary. In Germany, being on time is very important, and people see lateness as impolite. However, in some Latin American countries, arriving a little late is normal and not a problem.

Another interesting difference is personal space. In Northern Europe, people like more space when they talk. In South America, people often stand closer and use more gestures.

Even though we have different customs and behaviours, travelling helps us see that people everywhere want the same things: kindness, respect, and good communication.
