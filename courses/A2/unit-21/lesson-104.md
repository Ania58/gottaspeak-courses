## Skills – Listening (5 min)
**Text: “How We Communicate in Groups”**

Good communication is important in every group. In my workplace, people get along well because they always try to listen to each other. When someone has a problem, we deal with it together instead of ignoring it.  

During meetings, our manager asks everyone to speak up if they have an idea. Some people are shy, but they are learning to express their opinions more confidently. We also depend on each other when we work on projects, because each person belongs to a different team and has different skills.  

Last month, we organised a big workshop. More than thirty people took part in it. The event showed that good communication helps us build strong relationships and solve difficult situations faster.
