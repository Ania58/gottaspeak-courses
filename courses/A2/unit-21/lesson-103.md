### **Text: “How We Express Our Opinions”**

People around the world express their opinions in different ways.  
Some people speak **confidently** and say exactly what they think. They use clear words and explain their ideas **carefully**, especially when the topic is important. Others prefer to speak more **quietly** and **politely**, because they don’t want to sound rude or too direct.

In many cultures, people show agreement by nodding or smiling, while in other countries people speak more directly and say “I totally agree” or “I completely disagree.”  
When people discuss difficult topics, they often speak **slowly** to choose their words well. In friendly conversations, people might speak **quickly** and laugh **easily**.

Understanding how people communicate helps us connect with others. When we listen **carefully** and speak **politely**, conversations become easier and more pleasant for everyone.
