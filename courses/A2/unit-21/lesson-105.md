## Skills – Reading (5 min)
### **Text: “A Friendly Evening”**

Last Friday, my colleague invited me to a small party at her house. At first, I didn’t know anyone there, so I tried to **break the ice** by asking simple questions about work and hobbies. After a few minutes, everyone relaxed.

Then something funny happened. I met a man who went to the same school as my cousin. I said, “Wow, **small world**!” We laughed and talked for a long time.

Later, our host really **went the extra mile**. She prepared snacks for everyone and introduced people who had similar interests. One guest didn’t want to join the group at first, but after talking a bit, she had a **change of heart** and started participating.

During the evening, I tried to **put myself in other people’s shoes**. Some were shy, some tired after work, so I tried to be patient and friendly. In the end, it was a great night, and I made two new friends.
