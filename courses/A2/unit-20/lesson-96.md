### **Text: “Planning My Next Holiday” **

Next summer, I’m **going to travel** to Portugal. I’ve never been there, so I’m really excited. I’m **flying** from Madrid on the 10th of July, and I’ve already checked the **departure** time.  
I’m **staying** in a small hostel near the old town because it’s cheaper and close to all the important places.

My **itinerary** is simple. On the first day, I’m going to walk around the city and do some **sightseeing**. The next day, I’m taking a train to the coast. I don’t know exactly which beach I’ll visit – I think I’ll just decide there. I like having some free time to explore.

I haven’t booked all my **accommodation** yet, but I will do it this week. I’m also going to buy **travel insurance**, just in case. If everything goes well, I’ll cross the **border** to Spain and spend a few days in Galicia before returning home.

It’s going to be a simple trip, but I’m sure I’ll enjoy it.
