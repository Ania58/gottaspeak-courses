**Text: “A Weekend Trip That Went Wrong”**

Last month, my friend Emma and I planned a short weekend trip to a small coastal town. We set off early on Saturday morning, but things became difficult very quickly. First, we ran out of petrol because we forgot to check the tank the day before. After we finally arrived, we went to the hotel to check in, but the receptionist couldn’t find our reservation.

We didn’t want to waste time, so we left our bags and decided to look around the town. We got on a local bus, but we didn’t know it would take us to the countryside instead of the beach. When we tried to return, the bus didn’t come for almost an hour.

In the end, the trip wasn’t perfect, but we still had fun. We learned two important lessons: always check your fuel before you set off, and always double-check your hotel reservation.

**Answer:**
1. What problems did Emma and the writer have during their trip?  
2. Which phrasal verbs from the lesson appear in the text?  
3. What two lessons did they learn?
