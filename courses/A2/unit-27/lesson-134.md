**Cultural Encounters Abroad**

When people travel or live abroad, cultural misunderstandings are common. A simple gesture, like a handshake or eye contact, can have different meanings in different cultures. What seems polite in one country may feel rude in another.

Many travellers say they feel like a *fish out of water* at first. They may get the wrong idea about people’s behaviour or feel that jokes are lost in translation. However, showing curiosity and respect helps a lot. Asking questions and observing how locals behave can break the ice and avoid problems.

In the end, adapting to local habits makes cultural encounters easier and more enjoyable.

3. What helps people adapt to a new culture?
