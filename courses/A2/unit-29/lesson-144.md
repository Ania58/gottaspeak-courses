**Text: Different People, Strong Relationships**

In every family or group, people have different personalities. Some are real people persons who enjoy talking, sharing ideas and helping others. They often give someone a hand without being asked. Others are quieter and prefer to listen rather than speak.

In relationships, it’s not always easy to see eye to eye. Friends can have different opinions, and sometimes this causes problems. However, strong relationships are built when people respect these differences and try to stay on the same page about important things. Even the black sheep of the family can play an important role by showing new ideas or a different way of thinking.

At work or at school, teamwork is essential. When people cooperate and support each other, problems are easier to solve. In the end, good communication and understanding help relationships grow stronger, even when people are not exactly the same.

**Answer:**  
1. What kinds of people are described in the text?  
2. Why is it important to respect differences?  
3. How can teamwork improve relationships?
