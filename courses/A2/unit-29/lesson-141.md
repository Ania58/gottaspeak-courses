## Skills – Reading (5 min)
**Text: Personalities at Work**

People work better together when they respect each other.  
Some people are very open-minded and like listening to new ideas.  
Others can be stubborn and find it hard to accept different opinions.  

Good relationships are built on honesty and support.  
Reliable people keep their promises and help when someone needs it.  
Jealous or selfish behaviour, however, can cause problems in teams.  

Although everyone is different, learning how to communicate politely  
and stay calm helps create better personal and professional relationships.

3. Which qualities are most important for you at work or in friendships?
