## Skills – Reading (5 min)
**Text: Education, Effort and Success**

For many students, school success doesn’t come overnight. At the beginning of a new subject, most learners need time to **learn the ropes**. New rules, new teachers and new expectations can feel stressful. However, students who are patient and ready to put in effort usually improve.

Before exams, some students really **hit the books**, while others prefer shorter but regular study sessions. What matters most is practice and understanding, not just memorising facts. For some learners, certain subjects are a **piece of cake**, but others need more time and support.

Success is not about being the **teacher’s pet**. It’s about showing progress, asking questions and not giving up after failure. In the end, students who keep practising and stay motivated usually **make the grade**.

**Answer:**
1. What helps students succeed at school?
2. Why is effort more important than being talented?
3. Which idiom best describes your learning experience?
