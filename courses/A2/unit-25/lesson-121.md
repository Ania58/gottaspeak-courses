## Skills – Reading (6 min)
**Text: Learning in Different Ways**

People learn in different ways. Some students like reading books and taking notes, while others prefer watching videos or listening to explanations. Many people learn better when they work with classmates and discuss ideas together.  

Some students like clear timetables and regular homework because it helps them stay organised. Others learn better when they can choose how and when they study. There is no single best way to learn – the most important thing is to understand what works best for you.  

Answer:  
1. What different learning styles are mentioned?

3. What does the text say is the most important thing about learning?
